	1. INTRODUCTION
	M 1 <em>a</em> 1. The1 role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in
	the
	thinking of the world. The reversal is characteristic. It seems as if
	the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving
	something to the learner rather than to himself. Further, the act of
	teaching is regarded as a special activity in which one engages only
	a relatively small proportion of oneʹs time. The course, on the other
	hand, emphasises that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and
	learner are the same. It also emphasises that teaching is a constant
	process; it goes on every moment of the day and continues into
	sleeping thoughts as well.
	M 1 <em>a</em> 2. To teach is to demonstrate. There are only two thought
	systems, and you demonstrate that you believe one or the other is
	true all the time. From your demonstration others learn and so do
	you. The question is not whether you will teach, for in that there is
	no choice. The purpose of the course might be said to provide you
	with a means of choosing what you want to teach on the basis of
	what you want to learn. You cannot give to someone else,2 and this
	you learn through teaching. Teaching is but a call to witnesses to
	attest to what you believe. It is a method of conversion. This is not
	done by words alone. Any situation must be to you a chance to
	teach others what you are and what they are to you. No more than
	that, but also never less.
	M 1 <em>a</em> 3. The curriculum that3 you set up is therefore determined
	exclusively by what you think you are, and what you believe the
	relationship of others is to you. In the formal teaching situation,
	these questions may be totally unrelated to what you think you are
	teaching. Yet it is impossible not to use the content of any situation
	1 APRIL 12, 1972
	2 FIP inserts “but only to yourself.” That insertion also appears written in
	between the lines in the
	Notes.
	3 FIP omits “that” but it is distinctly present in the Notes.

	on behalf of what you really teach and therefore4 learn. To this the
	verbal content of your teaching is quite irrelevant. It may coincide
	with it or it may not. It is the teaching underlying what you say that
	teaches you. Teaching but reïnforces what you believe about
	yourself. Its fundamental M(2) purpose is to diminish self‐doubt.
	This does not mean that the self you are trying to protect is real. But
	it does mean that the self you think is real is what you teach.
	M 1 <em>a</em> 4. This is inevitable. There is no escape from it. How could it
	be otherwise? Everyone who follows the worldʹs curriculum, and
	everyone here does follow it until he changes his mind, teaches
	solely to convince himself that he is what he is not. Herein is the
	purpose of the world. What else, then, would its curriculum be?
	Into this hopeless and closed learning situation, which teaches
	nothing but despair and death, God sends His teachers. And as
	they teach His lessons of joy and hope, their learning finally
	becomes complete.
	M 1 <em>a</em> 5. Except for Godʹs teachers there would be no5 hope of
	salvation, for the world of sin would be forever real. The selfdeceiving
	must deceive, for they must teach deception. And what
	else is hell? This is a manual for the teachers of God. They are not
	perfect or they would not be here. Yet it is their mission to become
	perfect here, and so they teach perfection over and over, in many,
	many ways, until they have learned it. And then they are seen no
	more, although their thoughts remain a source of strength and truth
	forever. Who are they? How are they chosen? What do they do?
	How can they work out their own salvation and the salvation of the
	world? This manual attempts to answer these questions. M(3)
	2. <em>who</em> ARE <em>God</em>’S <em>teachers</em>?
	M 2 <em>a</em> 1. A teacher of God is anyone who chooses to be one. His
	qualifications consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has
	made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as
	4 FIP inserts “really” which is also written between the lines in the Notes.
	5 FIP changes “no” to “little.” It is “no” in the Notes.

	III‐3
	apart from someone elseʹs. Once he has done that his road is
	established and his direction is sure. A light has entered the
	darkness.6 It may be a single light, but that is enough. He has
	entered an agreement with God, even if he does not yet believe in
	Him. He has become a bringer of salvation.7 He has become a
	teacher of God.
	M 2 <em>a</em> 2. They come from all over the world. They come from all
	religions and from no religion. They are the ones who have
	answered. The Call is universal. It goes on all the time everywhere.
	It calls for teachers to speak for it and redeem the world. Many hear
	it but few will answer.8 But9 it is all a matter of time. Everyone will
	answer in the end, but the end can be a long, long way off. It is
	because of this that the plan of the teachers was established. Their
	function is to save time. Each one begins as a single light, but with
	the Call at its centre it is a light that cannot be limited. And each
	one saves a thousand years of time as the world judges it. To the
	Call itself time has no meaning.
	M 2 <em>a</em> 3. There is a course for every teacher of God. The form of the
	course varies greatly. So do the particular teaching aids involved.
	But the content of the course never changes. Its central theme is
	always, “Godʹs Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his
	salvation.” It can be taught by actions or thoughts; in words or
	soundlessly; in any language or in no language; in any place or time
	or manner. It does not matter who the teacher was before he heard
	the Call. He has become a savior by his answering. He has seen
	someone else as himself. He has therefore found his own salvation
	and the salvation of the world. In his rebirth is the world reborn.
	M(4)
	6 Luke 1:79 “To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of
	death, To guide our feet into
	the way of peace.”
	John 1:5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not
	comprehend it.
	7 Luke 1:77 “To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of
	their sins,”
	8 Matthew 20:16 “So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are
	called, but few chosen.”
	9 FIP changes “But” to “Yet.” The Notes has “yet.”
	1661 PROOF COPY

	III‐4
	M 2 <em>a</em> 4. This10 is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for
	teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many
	thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome. They merely
	save time. Yet it is time alone that winds on wearily, and the world
	is very tired now. It is old and worn and without hope. There was
	never a question of outcome, for what can change the Will of God?
	But time, with its illusions of change and death, wears out the world
	and all things in it. Yet time has an ending, and it is this that the
	teachers of God are appointed to bring about. For time is in their
	hands. Such was their choice, and it is given them.
	3. <em>who</em> ARE <em>their</em> PUPILS?
	M 3 <em>a</em> 1. Certain pupils have been assigned to each of Godʹs teachers,
	and they will begin to look for him as soon as he has answered the
	Call. They were chosen for him because the form of the universal
	curriculum that he will teach is best for them in view of their level of
	understanding. His pupils have actually11 been waiting for him, for
	his coming is certain. Again, it is only a matter of time. Once he has
	chosen to fulfill his role, they are ready to fulfill theirs. Time waits
	on his choice, but not whom he will serve. When he is ready to
	learn, the opportunities to teach will be provided for him.
	M 3 <em>a</em> 2. In order to understand the teaching‐learning plan of
	salvation, it is necessary to grasp the concept of time which12 the
	course sets forth. Atonement corrects illusions, not truth.
	Therefore, it corrects what never was. Further, the plan for this
	correction was established and completed simultaneously, for the
	Will of God is entirely apart from time. So is all reality, being of
	Him. The instant the idea of separation entered the mind of Godʹs
	Son, in that same instant was Godʹs Answer given. In time this
	happened very long ago. In reality it never happened at all. M(5)
	10 (April 27 1972)
	11 Handwritten mark-up suggests the insertion of “actually.” The Notes has
	“actually.”
	12 FIP changes “which” to “that.” The Notes has “which.”
	1662 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐5
	M 3 <em>a</em> 3. The world of time is the world of illusion. What happened
	long ago seems to be happening now. Choices made long since
	appear to be open; yet to be made. What has been learned and
	understood and long ago passed by is looked upon as a new
	thought, a fresh idea, a different approach. Because your will is free
	you can accept what has already happened at any time you choose,
	and only then will you realise that it was always there. As the
	course emphasises, you are not free to choose the curriculum, or
	even the form in which you will learn it. You are free, however, to
	decide when you want to learn it. And as you accept it, it is already
	learned.
	M 3 <em>a</em> 4. Time really, then, goes backward to an instant so ancient
	that it is beyond all memory and past even the possibility of
	remembering. Yet because it is an instant that is relived again and
	again and still again, it seems to be now. And thus it is that pupil
	and teacher seem to come together in the present, finding each other
	as if they had not met before. The pupil comes at the right time to
	the right place. This is inevitable, because he made the right choice
	in that ancient instant which he now relives. So has the teacher, too,
	made an inevitable choice out of an ancient past. Godʹs Will in
	everything but seems to take time in the working‐out. What could
	delay the power of eternity?
	M 3 <em>a</em> 5. When pupil and teacher come together, a teaching‐learning
	situation begins. For the teacher is not really the one who does the
	teaching. Godʹs Teacher speaks to any two who join together for
	learning purposes.13 The relationship is holy because of that
	purpose, and God has promised to send His Spirit into any holy
	relationship. In the teaching‐learning situation, each one learns that
	giving and receiving are the same. The demarcations they have
	drawn between their roles, their minds, their bodies, their needs,
	their interests, and all the differences they thought separated them
	from one another, fade and grow dim and disappear. Those who
	13 Matthew 18:20 “For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I
	am there in the midst of
	them.”
	1663 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐6
	would learn the same course share one interest and one goal. And
	thus he who was the learner becomes a teacher M(6) of God Himself,
	for he has made the one decision that gave his teacher to him. He
	has seen in another person the same interests as his own.
	4. <em>what</em> ARE <em>the</em> LEVELS <em>of teaching</em>?
	M 4 <em>a</em> 1. The teachers of God have no set teaching level. Each
	teaching‐learning situation involves a different relationship at the
	beginning, although the ultimate goal is always the same; to make of
	the relationship a holy relationship, in which both can look upon the
	Son of God as sinless. There is no‐one from whom a teacher of God
	cannot learn, so there is no‐one whom he cannot teach. However,
	from a practical point of view he cannot meet everyone, nor can
	everyone find him. Therefore, the plan includes very specific
	contacts to be made for each teacher of God. There are no accidents
	in salvation. Those who are to meet will meet, because together
	they have the potential for a holy relationship. They are ready for
	each other.
	M 4 <em>a</em> 2. The simplest level of teaching appears to be quite
	superficial. It consists of what seem to be very casual encounters; a
	chance meeting of two apparent strangers in an elevator, a child
	who is not looking where he is going running into an adult “by
	accident,ʺ14 two students who happen15 to walk home together.
	These are not chance encounters. Each of them has the potential for
	becoming a teaching‐learning situation.16 Perhaps the seeming
	strangers in the elevator will smile to one another, perhaps the
	man17 will not scold the child for bumping into him; perhaps the
	students will become friends. Even at the level of the most casual
	encounter, it is possible for two people to lose sight of separate
	14 FIP changes “accident” to “chance.” The Notes has “accident.”
	15 FIP changes “who happen” to “happening.” The Notes has “who happen.”
	16 The Urtext manuscript has this sentence originally typed as “Each of them
	has a potential for
	becoming teaching-learning situations.” Handwritten mark-up changes the
	sentence to the way it is in
	the Notes, which is also how it appears above.
	17 FIP changes “man” to “adult.” The Notes has “man.”

	III‐7
	interests, if only for a moment. That moment will be enough.
	Salvation has come. M(7)
	M 4 <em>a</em> 3. It is difficult to understand that levels of teaching the
	universal course is a concept as meaningless in reality as is time.
	The illusion of one permits the illusion of the other. In time, the
	teacher of God seems to begin to change his mind about the world
	with a18 single decision, and then learns more and more about the
	new direction as he teaches it. We have covered the illusion of time
	already, but the illusion of levels of teaching seems to be something
	different. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate that these levels
	cannot exist is simply to say that any level of the teaching‐learning
	situation is part of Godʹs plan for Atonement, and His plan can have
	no levels, being a reflection of His Will. Salvation is always ready
	and always there. Godʹs teachers work at different levels, but the
	result is always the same.
	M 4 <em>a</em> 4. Each teaching‐learning situation is maximal in the sense
	that
	each person involved will learn the most that he can from the other
	person at that time. In this sense, and in this sense only, we can
	speak of levels of teaching. Using the term in this way, the second
	level of teaching is a more sustained relationship, in which, for a
	time, two people enter into a fairly intense teaching‐learning
	situation and then appear to separate. As with the first level, these
	meetings are not accidental, nor is what appears to be the end of the
	relationship a real end. Again, each has learned the most he can at
	the time. Yet all who meet will someday meet again, for it is the
	destiny of all relationships to become holy. God is not mistaken in
	His Son.
	M 4 <em>a</em> 5. The third level of teaching occurs in relationships which,
	once they are formed, are lifelong. These are teaching‐learning
	situations in which each person is given a chosen learning partner
	who presents him with unlimited opportunities for learning. These
	relationships are generally few, because their existence implies that
	18 The manuscript has “the.” Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “the” to “a”
	which reflects the
	Notes.
	1665 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐8
	those involved have reached a stage simultaneously in which the
	teaching‐learning balance is actually perfect. This does not mean
	that M(8) they necessarily recognise this; in fact, they generally do
	not. They may even be quite hostile to each other for some time,
	and perhaps for life. Yet should they decide to learn it, the perfect
	lesson is before them and can be learned. And if they decide to
	learn that lesson, they become the saviors of the teachers who falter
	and may even seem to fail. No teacher of God can fail to find the
	Help he needs.
	5. <em>what</em> ARE <em>the</em> CHARACTERISTICS <em>of God</em>’S
	<em>teachers</em>?
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	M 5 <em>a</em> 1. The19 surface traits of Godʹs teachers are not at all alike.
	They do not look alike to the bodyʹs eyes, they come from vastly
	different backgrounds, their experiences of the world vary greatly,
	and their superficial “personalities” are quite distinct. Nor at the
	beginning stages of their functioning as teachers of God, have they20
	yet acquired the deeper characteristics that will establish them as
	what they are. God gives special gifts to His teachers because they
	have a special role in His plan for Atonement. Their specialness is,
	of course, only temporary; set in time as a means of leading out of
	time. These special gifts, born in the holy relationship toward which
	the teaching‐learning situation is geared, become characteristic of all
	teachers of God who have advanced in their own learning. In this
	respect they are all alike.
	M 5 <em>a</em> 2. All differences among the Sons of God are temporary.
	Nevertheless, in time it can be said that the advanced teachers of
	God have the following characteristics:
	19 May 26, 1972
	20 FIP inserts “as” after “they.” This does not appear to be present in the
	Notes, but the Notes legibility
	is poor, leaving the question somewhat open.
	1666 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐9
	B. Trust
	M 5 B 1. This is the foundation on which their ability to fulfill their
	function rests. Perception is21 the22 result of learning. In fact,
	perception is learning, because cause and effect are never separated.
	The teachers of God have trust in the world, because they have
	learned it is not governed by the laws the M(9) world made up. It is
	governed by a Power which is in them but not of them.23 It is this
	Power that keeps all things safe. It is through this Power that the
	teachers of God look on a forgiven world.
	M 5 B 2. When this Power has once been experienced, it is impossible
	to trust oneʹs own petty strength again. Who would attempt to fly
	with the tiny wings of a sparrow when the mighty power of an
	eagle has been given him? And who would place his faith in the
	shabby offerings of the ego when the gifts of God are laid before
	him? What is it that induces them to make the shift?
	M 5 B 3. First, they must go through what might be called “a period
	of undoing.” This need not be painful, but it usually is so
	experienced. It seems as if things are being taken away, and it is
	rarely understood initially that their lack of value is merely being
	recognised. How can lack of value be perceived unless the
	perceiver is in a position where he must see things in a different
	light? He is not yet at a point at which he can make the shift entirely
	internally. And so the plan will sometimes call for changes in what
	seem to be external circumstances. These changes are always
	helpful. When the teacher of God has learned that much, he goes on
	to the second stage.
	M 5 B 4. Next, the teacher of God must go through “a period of
	sorting‐out.” This is always somewhat difficult because, having
	21 FIP adds emphasis. The Notes does not.
	22 The manuscript has “a”; Handwritten mark-up and FIP suggest “the” instead
	of “a” which reflects the
	Notes.
	23 John 15:19 “If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet
	because you are not of the
	world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.”
	1 John 4:4 “Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because
	greater is he that is in
	you than he that is in the world.”
	1667 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐10
	learned that the changes in his life are always helpful, he must now
	decide all things on the basis of whether they increase the
	helpfulness or hamper it. He will find that many, if not most of the
	things he valued before will merely hinder his ability to transfer
	what he has learned to new situations as they arise. Because he has
	valued what is really valueless, he will not generalize the lesson for
	fear of loss and sacrifice. M(10) It takes great learning to understand
	that all things, events, encounters and circumstances are helpful. It
	is only to the extent to which they are helpful that any degree of
	reality should be accorded them in this world of illusion. The word
	“value” can apply to nothing else.
	M 5 B 5. The third stage through24 which the teacher of God must go
	can be called a “period of relinquishment.” If this is interpreted as
	giving up the desirable it will engender enormous conflict. Few
	teachers of God escape this distress entirely. There is, however, no
	point in sorting out the valuable from the valueless unless the next
	obvious step is taken. The third step is rarely if ever begun until the
	second is complete.25 Therefore, the period of overlap is apt to be
	one in which the teacher of God feels called upon to sacrifice his
	own best interests on behalf of truth. He has not realised as yet how
	wholly impossible such a demand would be. He can learn this only
	as he actually does give up the valueless. Through this, he learns
	that where he anticipated grief, he finds a happy light‐heartedness
	instead; where he thought something was asked of him he finds a
	gift bestowed on26 him.
	M 5 B 6. Now comes “a period of settling down.” This is a quiet time,
	in which the teacher of God rests a while in reasonable peace. Now
	he consolidates his learning. Now he begins to see the transfer
	value of what he has learned. Its potential is literally staggering,
	and the teacher of God is now at the point in his progress at which
	24 Urtext manuscript has “to” originally typed. Handwritten mark-up inserts
	“through.” The Notes has
	the glyph for “through.”
	25 This sentence omitted by FIP, (all editions) but it is present in the
	Notes.

	which reflects the
	Notes.

	III‐11
	he sees in it his whole way out. “Give up what you do not want,
	and keep what you do.” How simple is the obvious. And how easy
	to do. The teacher of God needs this period of respite. He has not
	yet come as far as he thinks. Yet when he is ready to go on, he goes
	with mighty companions beside him. Now he rests a while, and
	gathers them before going on. He will not go on from here alone.
	M(11)
	M 5 B 7. The next stage is indeed “a period of unsettling.” Now must
	the teacher of God understand that he did not really know what was
	valuable and what was valueless. All that he really learned so far
	was that he did not want the valueless and that he did want the
	valuable. Yet his own sorting out was meaningless in teaching him
	the difference. The idea of sacrifice, so central to his own thought
	system, had made it impossible for him to judge. He thought he
	had27 learned willingness, but now he sees that he does not know
	what the willingness is for. And now he must attain a state that
	may remain impossible28 for a long, long time. He must learn to lay
	all judgement aside and ask only what he really wants in every
	circumstance. Were not each step in this direction so heavily
	reinforced, it would be hard indeed.
	M 5 B 8. And finally, there is “a period of achievement.” It is here
	that learning is consolidated. Now what was seen as merely
	shadows before become29 solid gains, to be counted on in all
	“emergencies” as well as tranquil times. Indeed, the tranquility is
	their result; the outcome of honest learning, consistency of thought
	and full transfer. This is the stage of real peace, for here is Heavenʹs
	state fully reflected. From here, the way to Heaven is open and
	easy. In fact, it is here. Who would “go” anywhere, if peace of
	mind is already complete? And who would seek to change
	27 FIP omits the word “had.” The Notes includes “had.”
	28 FIP inserts “to reach” which words are not present in the Notes.
	29 Originally typed “becomes.” FIP makes this “become” which reflects the
	Notes. There is more than
	one way to understand the grammar here. “What was seen as shadows” could be
	considered a singular
	noun clause or the subject could be considered “shadows” which is plural,
	making either “becomes’ or
	“become” appropriate. We’re opting for the majority view here.

	tranquility for something more desirable? What could be more
	desirable than this? M(12)
	C. Honesty
	M 5 C 1. All other traits of Godʹs teachers rest on trust. Once that has
	been achieved the others cannot fail to follow. Only the trusting can
	afford honesty, for only they can see its value. Honesty does not
	apply only to30 what you say. The term actually means consistency.
	There is nothing you say that contradicts what you think or do; no
	thought opposes any other thought; no act belies your word; and no
	word lacks agreement with another. Such are the truly honest. At
	no level are they in conflict with themselves. Therefore it is
	impossible for them to be in conflict with anyone or anything.
	M 5 C 2. The peace of mind which the advanced teachers of God
	experience is largely due to their perfect honesty. It is only the wish
	to deceive that makes for war. No‐one at one with himself can even
	conceive of conflict. Conflict is the inevitable result of selfdeception,
	and self‐deception is dishonesty. There is no challenge to
	a teacher of God. Challenge implies doubt, and the trust on which
	Godʹs teachers rest secure makes doubt impossible. Therefore they
	can only succeed. In this as in all things they are honest. They can
	only succeed, because they never do their will alone. They choose
	for all mankind; for all the world and all things in it; for the
	unchanging and unchangeable beyond appearances; and for the Son
	of God and his Creator. How could they not succeed? They choose
	in perfect honesty, sure of their choice of themselves.
	D. Tolerance
	M 5 D 1. Godʹs teachers do not judge. To judge is to be dishonest, for
	to judge is to assume a position you do not have. Judgement without
	self‐deception is impossible. Judgement implies that you have been
	deceived in your brothers. How then could you not have been
	deceived in yourself? Judgement implies a lack of trust, and trust
	30 Originally typed, “to only,” handwritten mark-up and FIP change this to
	“only to” which reflects the
	Notes.
	1670 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐13
	remains the bedrock of the teacher of Godʹs whole thought system.
	M(13) Let this be lost and all his learning goes. Without judgement
	are all things equally acceptable, for who could judge otherwise?
	Without judgement are all men brothers, for who is there who stands
	apart? Judgement destroys honesty and shatters trust. No teacher of
	God can judge and hope to learn.
	E. Gentleness
	M 5 E 1. Harm is impossible for Godʹs teachers. They can neither
	harm nor be harmed. Harm is the outcome of judgement. It is the
	dishonest act that follows a31 dishonest thought. It is a verdict of
	guilt upon a brother and therefore on oneself. It is the end of peace
	and the denial of learning. It demonstrates the absence of Godʹs
	curriculum and its replacement by insanity. No teacher of God but
	must learn, – and fairly early in his training, – that harmfulness
	completely obliterates his function from his awareness. It will make
	him confused, fearful, angry and suspicious. It will make the Holy
	Spiritʹs lessons impossible to learn. Nor can Godʹs Teacher be heard
	at all except by those who realise that harm can actually achieve
	nothing. No gain can come from32 it.
	M 5 E 2. Therefore Godʹs teachers are wholly gentle. They need the
	strength of gentleness, for it is in this that the function of salvation
	becomes easy. To those who would do harm it is impossible. To
	those to whom harm has no meaning it is merely natural. What
	choice but this has meaning to the sane? Who chooses hell when he
	perceives a way to Heaven? And who would choose the weakness
	that must come from harm in place of the unfailing, allencompassing
	and limitless strength of gentleness? The might of
	Godʹs teachers lies in their gentleness, for they have understood
	their evil thoughts came neither from Godʹs Son nor his Creator.
	Thus did they join their thoughts with Him Who is their Source.
	And so their will, which always was His Own, is free to be itself.
	M(14)
	31 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “the” to “a” which change reflects the
	Notes.
	32 FIP changes “from” to “of” but the Notes and the Urtext manuscript clearly
	have “from.”
	1671 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐14
	F. Joy
	M 5 F 1. Joy is the inevitable result of gentleness. Gentleness means
	that fear is now impossible, and what could come to interfere with
	joy? The open hands of gentleness are always filled. The gentle
	have no pain. They cannot suffer. Why would they not be joyous?
	They are sure they are beloved and must be safe. Joy goes with
	gentleness as surely as grief attends attack. Godʹs teachers trust in
	Him. And they are sure His Teacher goes before them, making sure
	no harm can come to them. They hold His gifts and follow in His
	way, because Godʹs Voice directs them in all things. Joy is their
	song of thanks. And Christ looks down on them in thanks as well.
	His need of them is just as great as theirs of Him. How joyous it is
	to share the purpose of salvation.
	G. Defenselessness
	M 5 G 1. Godʹs teachers have learned how to be simple. They have
	no dreams that need defence against the truth.33 They do not try to
	make themselves. Their joy comes from their understanding Who
	created them. And does what God created need defence? No‐one
	can become an advanced teacher of God until he fully understands
	that defences are but the34 foolish guardians of mad illusions. The
	more grotesque the dream, the fiercer and more powerful its
	defences seem to be. Yet when the teacher of God finally agrees to
	look past them, he finds35 nothing was there. Slowly at first he lets
	himself be undeceived. But he learns faster as his trust increases. It
	is not danger that comes when defences are laid down. It is safety.
	It is peace. It is joy. And it is God. M(15)
	H. Generosity
	M 5 H 1. The term generosity has special meaning to the teacher of
	God. It is not the usual meaning of the word; in fact, it is a meaning
	that must be learned and learned very carefully. Like all the other
	33 Urtext manuscript has “trust” crossed out and “truth” penciled in. The
	Notes and FIP both have
	“truth.”
	34 FIP omits “the” but the Notes retains it.
	35 FIP adds “that” which is not present in the Notes.
	1672 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐15
	attributes of Godʹs teachers this one rests ultimately on trust, for
	without trust no‐one can be generous in the true sense. To the
	world, generosity means “giving away” in the sense of “giving up.”
	To the teachers of God, it means “giving away” in order to keep.
	This has been <em>emphasised</em> throughout the text and the workbook,
	but it is perhaps more alien to the thinking of the world than many
	other ideas in our curriculum. Its greater strangeness lies merely in
	the obviousness of its reversal of the worldʹs thinking. In the
	clearest way possible and at the simplest of levels, the word means
	the exact opposite to the teachers of God and to the world.
	M 5 H 2. The teacher of God is generous out of Self‐interest.36 This
	does not refer, however, to the self the world speaks of.37 The
	teacher of God does not want anything he cannot give away,
	because he realises it would be valueless to him by definition. What
	would he want it for? He could only lose because of it. He could
	not gain. Therefore he does not seek what only he could keep,
	because that is a guarantee of loss. He does not want to suffer. Why
	should he ensure himself pain? But he does want to keep for
	himself all things that are of God, and therefore for His Son. These
	are the things that belong to him. These he can give away in true
	generosity, protecting them forever for himself. M(16)
	I. Patience
	M 5 I 1. Those who are certain of the outcome can afford to wait, and
	wait without anxiety. Patience is natural to the teacher of God. All
	he sees is certain outcome, at a time perhaps unknown38 as yet, but
	not in doubt. The time will be as right as is the answer. And this is
	true for everything that happens now or in the future. The past as
	well held no mistakes; nothing that did not serve to benefit the
	world as well as him to whom it seemed to happen. Perhaps it was
	36 Urtext manuscript does not capitalize “Self” here, but FIP does and we
	agree it should be capitalized.
	It is not clear from the Notes whether this was originally capitalized or not.
	37 FIP changes this to “to the self of which the world speaks” which is
	arguably better grammar.
	However, the Notes has it as it stands.
	38 FIP inserts “to him” but that is not present in the Notes.
	1673 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐16
	not understood at the time. Even so, the teacher of God is willing to
	reconsider all his past decisions, if they are causing pain to anyone.
	Patience is natural to those who trust. Sure of the ultimate
	interpretation of all things in time, no outcome already seen or yet
	to come can cause them fear.
	J. Faithfulness
	M 5 J 1. The extent of the teacher of Godʹs faithfulness is the measure
	of his advancement in the curriculum. Does he still select some
	aspects of his life to bring to his learning, while keeping others
	apart? If so, his advancement is limited and his trust not yet firmly
	established. Faithfulness is the teacher of Godʹs trust in the Word of
	God to set all things right; not some, but all. Generally, his
	faithfulness begins by resting on just some problems, remaining
	carefully limited for a time. To give up all problems to one Answer
	is to reverse the thinking of the world entirely. And that alone is
	faithfulness. Nothing but that really deserves the name. Yet each
	degree, however small, is worth achieving. Readiness, as the text
	notes, is not mastery.
	M 5 J 2. True faithfulness, however, does not deviate. Being
	consistent it is wholly honest. Being unswerving it is full of trust.
	Being based on fearlessness it is gentle. Being certain it is joyous,
	and being confident it is tolerant. Defenselessness attends it
	naturally, and joy is its condition.39 Faithfulness, then, combines in
	itself the other attributes of God’s teachers. It implies acceptance of
	the Word of God and His definition of His Son. It is to Them M(17)
	that faithfulness in the true sense is always directed. Toward Them
	it looks, seeking until it finds.40 And having found, it rests in quiet
	certainty on That alone to which all faithfulness is due.
	39 FIP moves this whole sentence forward by four sentences, beginning after
	“finds.” and before “And
	having” but in the Notes it is the same as it appears here.
	40 Matthew 7:7-8 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be
	opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to
	him who knocks it will
	be opened.”

	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐17
	K. Open‐Mindedness
	M 5 K 1. The centrality of open‐mindedness, perhaps the last of the
	attributes the teacher of God acquires, is easily understood when its
	relation to forgiveness is recognised. Open‐mindedness comes with
	lack of judgement. As judgement shuts the mind against God’s
	Teacher, so open‐mindedness invites Him to come in. As
	condemnation judges the Son of God as evil, so open‐mindedness
	permits him to be judged by the Voice for God on His behalf. As the
	projection of guilt upon him would send him to hell, so openmindedness
	lets Christ’s image be projected on41 him. Only the
	open‐minded can be at peace, for they alone see reason for it.
	M 5 K 2. How do the open‐minded forgive? They have let go all
	things that would prevent forgiveness. They have in truth
	abandoned the world, and let it be restored to them in newness and
	in joy so glorious they never could42 have conceived of such a
	change. Nothing is now as it was formerly. Nothing but sparkles
	now which seemed so dull and lifeless before. And above all are all
	things welcoming, for threat has43 gone. No clouds remain to hide
	the Face of Christ. Now is the goal achieved. Forgiveness is the
	final goal of the curriculum. It paves the way for what goes far
	beyond all learning. The curriculum makes no effort to exceed its
	legitimate goal. Forgiveness is its single aim, at which all learning
	ultimately converges. It is indeed enough.
	M 5 K 3. You may have noticed that the list of attributes of Godʹs
	teachers does not include those things which are the Son of Godʹs
	inheritance. Terms like love, sinlessness, perfection, knowledge,
	and eternal truth do not appear in this context. They would be most
	inappropriate here. What God has given is so far M(18) beyond our
	curriculum that learning but disappears in its presence. Yet while
	41 FIP changes “projected on” to “extended to” but the Notes has “projected
	on.” The distinction
	between “projection” (of the ego) and “extension” (more divine) which the
	later editing makes is
	frequently not made in the original dictation which uses “project”
	interchangeably with “extend” in a
	number of instances to refer to a divine and loving projection.
	42 FIP changes “never could” to “could never.” The Notes has “never could.”
	43 FIP changes “has gone” to “is gone” but the Notes clearly has “has gone.”
	1675 PROOF COPY

	III‐18
	its presence is obscured, the focus properly belongs on the
	curriculum. It is the function of Godʹs teachers to bring true
	learning to the world. Properly speaking, it is unlearning that they
	bring, for that is “true learning” in the world. It is given to the
	teachers of God to bring the glad tidings44 of complete forgiveness
	to the world. Blessed indeed are they, for they are the Bringers of
	salvation.45
	6. <em>how is</em> HEALING ACCOMPLISHED?
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	M 6 <em>a</em> 1. Healing involves an understanding of what the illusion of
	sickness is for. Healing is impossible without this.
	B. The perceived purpose of sickness
	M 6 B 1. Healing is accomplished the instant the sufferer no longer
	sees any value in pain. Who would choose suffering unless he
	thought it brought him something, and something of value to him?
	He must think it is a small price to pay for something of greater
	worth. For sickness is an election; a decision. It is the choice of
	weakness, in the mistaken conviction that it is strength. When this
	occurs, real strength is seen as threat and health as danger. Sickness
	is a method, conceived in madness, for placing Godʹs Son on his
	Fatherʹs throne. God is seen as outside, fierce and powerful, eager
	to keep all power for Himself. Only by his death can He be
	conquered by His Son.
	M 6 B 2. And what, in this insane conviction, does healing stand for?
	It symbolizes the defeat of Godʹs Son and the triumph of his Father
	over him. It represents the ultimate defiance in a direct form which
	the Son of God is forced to recognise. It stands for all that he would
	44 Luke 1:19 And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands
	in the presence of
	God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings.” Luke 8:1
	Now it came to pass,
	afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing
	the glad tidings of the
	kingdom of God.
	45 Isaiah 45:8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
	righteousness: let the
	earth open, that they may bring forth salvation, and let her cause
	righteousness to spring up together; I
	the LORD have created it.

	III‐19
	hide from himself to protect his life. If he is healed, he is responsible
	for his thoughts. And if he is responsible for his thoughts he will be
	killed, to prove to him how weak and pitiful he is. But if he chooses
	death himself, his weakness is his strength. Now has he given
	himself what God would give to him, and thus entirely usurped the
	throne of his Creator. M(19)
	C. The shift in perception
	M 6 C 1. Healing must occur in exact proportion in46 which the
	valuelessness of sickness is recognised. One need but say, “There is
	no gain at all to me in this,” and he is healed. But to say this one
	must first recognise certain facts. First, it is obvious that decisions
	are of the mind, not of the body. If sickness is but a faulty problemsolving
	approach, it is a decision. And if it is a decision, it is the
	mind and not the body that makes it. The resistance to recognising
	this is enormous, because the existence of the world as we47 perceive
	it depends on the body being the decision‐maker. Terms like
	“instincts,” “reflexes” and the like represent attempts to endow the
	body with non‐mental motivators. Actually, such terms merely
	state or describe the problem. They do not answer it.
	M 6 C 2. The acceptance of sickness as a decision of the mind, for a
	purpose for which it would use the body, is the basis of healing.
	And this is so for healing in all forms. A patient decides that this is
	so, and he recovers. If he decides against recovery he will not be
	healed. Who is the physician? Only the mind of the patient himself.
	The outcome is what he decides that it is. Special agents seem to be
	ministering to him, yet they but give form to his own choice. He
	chooses them48 to bring tangible form to his desires. And it is this
	they do, and nothing else. They are not actually needed at all. The
	patient could merely rise up without their aid and say, “I have no
	use for this.” There is no form of sickness that would not be cured at
	once.
	46 FIP replaces the manuscript “in” with “to”, but the Notes has “in.”
	47 FIP changes “we” to “you” but in the Notes the glyph for “we” is used.
	48 FIP inserts “in order” which is not present in the Notes.
	1677 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐20
	M 6 C 3. What is the single requisite for this shift in perception? It is
	simply this; the recognition that sickness is of the mind, and has
	nothing to do with the body. What does this recognition “costʺ? It
	costs the world49 we see, for the world will never again appear to
	rule the mind. For with this recognition is responsibility placed
	where it belongs; not with the world, but on him who looks on the
	world and sees it as it is not. He looks on what he chooses to see.
	No more and no less. The world does nothing to him. M(20) He only
	thought it did. Nor does he do anything to the world, because he
	was mistaken about what it was.50 Herein is the release from guilt
	and sickness both, for they are one. Yet to accept this release, the
	insignificance of the body must be an acceptable idea.
	M 6 C 4. With this idea is pain forever gone. But with this idea goes
	also all confusion about creation. Does not this follow of necessity?
	Place cause and effect in their true sequence in one respect, and the
	learning will generalize and transform the world. The transfer
	value of one true idea has no end nor51 limit. The final outcome of
	this lesson is the remembrance of God. What do guilt and sickness,
	pain, disaster and all suffering mean now? Having no purpose, they
	are gone. And with them also go52 all the effects they seemed to
	cause. Cause and effect but replicate creation. Seen in their proper
	perspective, without distortion and without fear, they re‐establish
	Heaven.
	D. The function of the Teacher of God
	M 6 D 1. If the patient must change his mind in order to be healed,
	what does the teacher of God do? Can he change the patientʹs mind
	for him? Certainly not. For those already willing to change their
	mind he has no function except to rejoice with them, for they have
	49 FIP changes “world we see” to “whole world you see” but in the Notes the
	glyph for “we” is used.
	50 FIP changes “was” to “is” but in the Notes it is “was.”
	51 FIP changes “nor” to “or” but in the Notes it is “nor.”
	52 Urtext manuscript has “goes” which appears to be a grammar error,
	disagreement in number. In the
	Notes, it was originally written “and with ??? (illegible crossed out
	characters)” followed by them.
	Possibly it was originally a singular noun making “goes” the correct form.
	However, with a plural noun
	“them,” it needs to be “go.” FIP also has “go.”
	1678 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐21
	become teachers of God with him. He has, however, a more specific
	function for those who do not understand what healing is. These
	patients do not realise they have chosen sickness. On the contrary,
	they believe that sickness has chosen them. Nor are they openminded
	on this point. The body tells them what to do and they
	obey. They have no idea how insane this concept is. If they even
	suspected it they would be healed. Yet they suspect nothing. To
	them the separation is quite real. M(21)
	M 6 D 2. To them God’s teachers come to represent another choice
	which they had forgotten. The simple presence of a teacher of God53
	is a reminder. Their54 thoughts ask for the right to question what
	the patient has accepted is true. As God’s messengers, they55 are the
	symbols of salvation. They ask the patient for forgiveness for God’s
	Son in his own Name. They stand for the Alternative. With God’s
	Word in their minds they come in benediction, not to heal the sick
	but to remind them of the remedy God has already given them. It is
	not their hands that heal. It is not their voice that speaks the Word
	of God. They merely give what has been given them. Very gently
	they call to their brothers to turn away from death. Behold, you Son
	of God, what life can offer you. Would you choose sickness in place
	of this?
	M 6 D 3. Not once do the advanced teachers of God consider the
	forms of sickness in which their brother believes. To do this is to
	forget that all of them have the same purpose and therefore are not
	really different. They seek for God’s Voice in this brother who
	would so deceive himself as to believe God’s Son can suffer. And
	they remind him that he has not made56 himself, and must remain as
	God created him. They recognise illusions can have no effect. The
	53 Both FIP and the manuscript have this as “a teacher of God” but in the
	manuscript that is crossed out
	and replaced with “God’s Teachers.” The subsequent pronoun (His vs. Their) is
	treated likewise. In
	the Notes it is ‘Their simple presence is” but then “a Teacher of God” is
	written in between the lines.
	54 Urtext manuscript has “Their” in brackets just before “His.” The Notes has
	“Their.”
	55 Both FIP and the manuscript have “His Teachers” but again, that is crossed
	out in the manuscript and
	replaced with “they.” The Notes has “they.”
	56 FIP changes “has not made” to “did not make.” The Notes has “has not made.”

	truth in their minds reaches out to the truth in the minds of their
	brothers, so that illusions are not reinforced. They are thus brought
	to truth, and truth is not brought to them. So are they dispelled, not
	by the will of another, but by the union of the One Will with Itself.
	And this is the function of God’s teachers; to see no will as separate
	from their own, nor theirs as separate from God’s. M(22)
	7. <em>is</em> HEALING <em>certain</em>?
	M 7 <em>a</em> 1. Healing is always certain. It is impossible to let illusions
	be
	brought to truth and keep the illusions. Truth demonstrates
	illusions have no value. The teacher of God has seen the correction
	of his errors in the mind of the patient, recognising it for what it is.
	Having accepted the Atonement for himself, he has also accepted it
	for the patient. Yet what if the patient uses sickness as a way of life,
	believing healing is the way to death? When this is so, a sudden
	healing may57 precipitate intense depression, and a sense of loss so
	deep that the patient may even try to destroy himself. Having
	nothing to live for, he may ask for death. Healing must wait, for his
	protection.
	M 7 <em>a</em> 2. Healing will always stand aside when58 it would be seen as
	threat. The instant it is welcome it is there. Where healing has been
	given it will be received. And what is time before the gifts of God?
	We have referred many times in the text to the storehouse of
	treasures laid up equally for the giver and the receiver of God’s
	gifts. Not one is lost, for they can but increase. No teacher of God
	should feel disappointed if he has offered healing and it does not
	appear to have been received. It is not up to him to judge when his
	gift should be accepted. Let him be certain it has been received, and
	trust that it will be accepted when it is recognised as a blessing and
	not a curse.

	crossed out in the manuscript
	and “where” is written in. The Notes has “when.”

	M 7 <em>a</em> 3. It is not the function of Godʹs teachers to evaluate the
	outcome of their gifts. It is merely their function to give them. Once
	they have done that, they have also given the outcome, for that is
	part of the gift. No‐one can give if he is concerned with the result of
	the59 giving. That is a limitation on the giving itself, and neither the
	giver nor the receiver would have the gift. Trust is an essential part
	of giving; in fact, it is the part that makes sharing possible, the part
	that guarantees the giver will not lose, but only gain. Who gives a
	gift, and then remains with it, to be sure it is used as the giver deems
	appropriate? Such is not giving but imprisoning. M(23)
	M 7 <em>a</em> 4. It is the relinquishing of all concern about the gift that
	makes
	it truly given. And it is trust that makes true giving possible.
	Healing is the change of mind that the Holy Spirit in the patientʹs
	mind is seeking for him. And it is the Holy Spirit in the mind of the
	giver Who gives the gift to him. How can it be lost? How can it be
	ineffectual? How can it be wasted? Godʹs treasure house can never
	be empty. And if one gift were60 missing it would not be full. Yet is
	its fullness guaranteed by God. What concern, then, can a teacher of
	God have about what becomes of his gifts? Given by God to God,
	who in this holy exchange can receive less than everything?
	8. SHOULD HEALING BE REPEATED?
	M 8 <em>a</em> 1. This question really answers itself. Healing cannot be
	repeated. If the patient is healed, what remains to heal him from?
	And if the healing is certain, as we have already said it is, what is
	there to repeat? For a teacher of God to remain concerned about the
	result of healing is to limit the healing. It is now the teacher of God
	himself whose mind needs to be healed. And it is this he must
	facilitate. He is now the patient, and he must so regard himself. He
	has made a mistake, and must be willing to change his mind about
	it. He lacked the trust that makes for giving truly, and so he has not
	received the benefit of his gift.

	M 8 <em>a</em> 2. Whenever a teacher of God has tried to be a channel for
	healing he has succeeded. Should he be tempted to doubt this, he
	should not repeat his previous effort. That was already maximal,
	because the Holy Spirit so accepted it and so used it. Now the
	teacher of God has only one course to follow. He must use his
	reason to tell himself that he has given the problem to One Who
	cannot fail, and61 recognise that his own uncertainty is not love but
	fear, and therefore hate. His position has thus become untenable,
	for he is offering M(24) hate to one to whom he offered love. This is
	impossible. Having offered love, only love can be received.
	M 8 <em>a</em> 3. It is in this that the teacher of God must trust. This is
	what
	is really meant by the statement that the one responsibility of the
	miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself. The teacher
	of God is a miracle worker because he gives the gifts he has
	received. Yet he must first accept them. He need do no more, nor is
	there more that he could do. By accepting healing he can give it. If
	he doubts this, let him remember Who gave the gift and Who
	received it. Thus is his doubt corrected. He thought the gifts of God
	could be withdrawn. That was a mistake, but hardly one to stay
	with. And so the teacher of God can only recognise it for what it is,
	and let it be corrected for him.
	M 8 <em>a</em> 4. One of the more62 difficult temptations to recognise is that
	to doubt a healing because of the appearance of continuing
	symptoms is a mistake in the form of lack of trust. As such, it is an
	attack. Usually it seems to be just the opposite. It does appear
	unreasonable at first to be told that continued concern is attack. It
	has all the appearance63 of love. Yet love without trust is
	impossible, and doubt and trust cannot coëxist. And hate must be
	the opposite of love, regardless of the form it takes. Doubt not the
	gift, and it is impossible to doubt its result. This is the certainty that
	61 FIP inserts “must” before “recognise” but that is not present in the Notes.
	62 FIP changes “more” to “most” but the Notes has “more.”

	gives God’s teachers the power to be miracle workers, for they have
	put their trust in Him.
	M 8 <em>a</em> 5. The real basis for doubt about the outcome of any problem
	that has been given to Godʹs Teacher for resolution is always selfdoubt.
	And that necessarily implies that trust has been placed in an
	illusory self, for only such a self can be doubted. This illusion can
	take many forms. Perhaps there is a fear of weakness and
	vulnerability. Perhaps there is64 fear of failure and shame associated
	with a sense of inadequacy. Perhaps there is a guilty M(25)
	embarrassment stemming from false humility. The form of the
	mistake is not important. What is important is only the recognition
	of a mistake as a mistake.
	M 8 <em>a</em> 6. The mistake is always some form of concern with the self to
	the exclusion of the patient. It is a failure to recognise him as part of
	the self, and thus represents a confusion in identity. Conflict about
	what you are has entered your mind, and you have become
	deceived about yourself. And you are deceived about yourself
	because you have denied the Source of your creation. If you are
	offering only healing, you cannot doubt. If you really want the
	problem solved, you cannot doubt. If you are certain what the
	problem is, you cannot doubt. Doubt is the result of conflicting
	wishes. Be sure of what you want, and doubt becomes impossible.
	9. <em>how</em> CAN <em>the perception of order of</em> DIFFICULTIES BE
	AVOIDED?
	M 9 <em>a</em> 1. The belief in order of difficulties is the basis for the
	worldʹs
	perception. It rests on differences; on uneven background and
	shifting foreground, on unequal heights and diverse sizes, on
	varying degrees of darkness and light, and thousands of contrasts in
	which each thing seen competes with every other in order to be
	recognised. A larger object overshadows a smaller one. A brighter
	thing draws the attention from another with less intensity of appeal.
	And a more threatening idea, or one conceived of as more desirable
	64 FIP inserts “a” before “fear.” There is no “a” in the Notes.
	1683 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐26
	by the worldʹs standards, completely upsets the mental balance.
	What the bodyʹs eyes behold is only conflict. Look not to them for
	peace and understanding.
	M 9 <em>a</em> 2. Illusions are always illusions of differences. How could it
	be otherwise? By definition, an illusion is an attempt to make
	something real that is regarded as of major importance, but is
	recognised as being untrue. The mind therefore seeks to make it
	true out of its intensity of desire to have it for itself. M(26) Illusions
	are travesties of creation; attempts to bring truth to lies. Finding
	truth unacceptable, the mind revolts against truth and gives itself an
	illusion of victory. Finding health a burden, it retreats into feverish
	dreams. And in these dreams the mind is separate, different from
	other minds, with different interests of its own, and able to gratify
	its needs at the expense of others.
	M 9 <em>a</em> 3. Where do all these differences come from? Certainly they
	seem to be in the world outside. Yet it is surely the mind that judges
	what the eyes behold. It is the mind that interprets the eyesʹ
	messages and gives them “meaning.” And this meaning does not
	exist in the world outside at all. What is seen as “reality” is simply
	what the mind prefers. Its hierarchy of values is projected outward,
	and it sends the bodyʹs eyes to find it. The bodyʹs eyes will never
	see except through differences. Yet it is not the messages they bring
	on which perception rests. Only the mind evaluates their messages,
	so65 only the mind is responsible for seeing. It alone decides
	whether what is seen is real or illusory, desirable or undesirable,
	pleasurable or painful.
	M 9 <em>a</em> 4. It is in the sorting out and categorizing activities of the
	mind
	that errors in perception enter. And it is here correction must be
	made. The mind classifies what the bodyʹs eyes bring to it
	according to its preconceived values, judging where each sense
	datum fits best. What basis could be faultier than this?
	Unrecognized by itself, it has itself asked to be given what will fit
	65 Handwritten mark-up and FIP add “and” before “so” but that is not present
	in the Notes.
	1684 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐27
	into these categories. And having done so, it concludes that the
	categories must be true. On this the judgement of all differences
	rests, because it is on this that judgements of the world depend. Can
	this confused and senseless “reasoning” be depended on for
	anything?
	M 9 <em>a</em> 5. There can be no order of difficulty in healing merely
	because all sickness is illusion. Is it harder to dispel the belief of the
	insane in a larger hallucination as opposed to a smaller one? Will he
	agree more quickly to the unreality of a louder voice he hears than
	to that of a softer one? Will he dismiss more easily a whispered
	demand to kill than a shout? And do the number of pitchforks the
	devils he sees carrying affect their credibility in his perception? His
	mind has categorized M(27) them66 as real, and so they are67 real to
	him. When he realises they are all illusions they will disappear.
	And so it is with healing. The properties of illusions which seem to
	make them different are really irrelevant, for their properties are as
	illusory as they are.
	M 9 <em>a</em> 6. The body’s eyes will continue to see differences,68 but the
	mind which69 has let itself be healed will no longer acknowledge
	them. There will be those who seem to be “sicker” than others, and
	the body’s eyes will report their changed appearances as before. But
	the70 mind will put them all in one category71 – they are unreal.
	This is the gift of its Teacher; the understanding that only two
	categories are meaningful in sorting out the messages the mind
	receives from what appears to be the outside world. And of these
	two but one is real. Just as reality is wholly real, apart from size and
	shape and time and place, for differences cannot exist within it, so

	too are illusions without distinctions.72 The one answer to sickness
	of any kind is healing. The one answer to all illusions is truth.
	10. ARE CHANGES REQUIRED <em>in the life</em> SITUATIONS <em>of God</em>’S
	<em>teachers</em>?
	M 10 <em>a</em> 1. Changes are required in the minds of Godʹs teachers. This
	may or may not involve changes in the external situation.
	Remember that no‐one is where he is by accident, and chance plays
	no part in Godʹs plan. It is most unlikely that changes in his
	attitudes would not be the first step in the newly‐made teacher of
	Godʹs training. There is, however, no set pattern, since training is
	always highly individualized. There are those who are called upon
	to change their life situation almost immediately, but these are
	generally special cases. By far the majority are given a slowlyevolving
	training program, in which as many previous mistakes as
	possible are corrected. Relationships in particular must be properly
	perceived, and all dark cornerstones of unforgiveness removed.
	Otherwise the old thought‐system still has a basis for return. M(28)
	M 10 <em>a</em> 2. As the teacher of God advances in his training, he learns
	one lesson with increasing thoroughness. He does not make his
	own decisions; he asks his Teacher for His answer, and it is this he
	follows as his guide for action. This becomes easier and easier, as
	the teacher of God learns to give up his own judgement. The giving
	up of judgement, the obvious prerequisite for hearing Godʹs Voice, is
	usually a fairly slow process, not because it is difficult, but because
	it is apt to be perceived as personally insulting. The worldʹs training
	is directed toward achieving a goal in direct opposition to that of
	our curriculum. The world trains for reliance on oneʹs judgement as
	the criterion for maturity and strength. Our curriculum trains for
	the relinquishment of judgement as the necessary condition of
	salvation.

	also pluralizes it.

	11. <em>how is</em> JUDGMENT RELINQUISHED?
	M 11 <em>a</em> 1. Judgement, like other devices by which the world of
	illusions is maintained, is totally misunderstood by the world. It is
	actually confused with wisdom, and substitutes for truth. As the
	world uses the term, an individual is capable of “good” and “bad”
	judgement, and his education aims at strengthening the former and
	minimizing the latter. There is, however, considerable confusion
	about what these categories mean. What is “good” judgement to one
	is “bad” judgement to another. Further, even the same person
	classifies the same action as showing “good” judgement at one time
	and “bad” judgement at another time. Nor can any consistent criteria
	for determining what these categories are be really taught. At any
	time the student may disagree with what his would‐be teacher says
	about it, and the teacher himself is inconsistent in what he believes
	they are.73 M(29)
	M 11 <em>a</em> 2. ʺGood judgement” in these terms, does not mean anything.
	No more does “bad.” It is necessary for the teacher of God to realise
	not that he should not judge, but that he cannot. In giving up
	judgement he merely gives up what he did not have. He gives up an
	illusion; or better, he has an illusion of giving up. He has actually
	merely become more honest. Recognizing that judgement was
	always impossible for him, he no longer attempts it. This is no
	sacrifice. On the contrary, he puts himself in a position where
	judgement through him rather than by him can occur. And this
	Judgement is neither “good” nor “bad.” It is the only Judgement there
	is, and it is only one: “Godʹs Son is guiltless, and sin does not exist.ʺ
	M 11 <em>a</em> 3. The aim of our curriculum, unlike the goal of the worldʹs
	learning, is the recognition that judgement in the usual sense is
	73 This sentence is heavily marked-up in the Urtext manuscript. The last words
	“they are” are
	handwritten in. FIP modifies this sentence to: “At any time the student may
	disagree with what his
	would-be teacher says about them, and the teacher himself may well be
	inconsistent in what he
	believes.” The Notes reads slightly differently “At any time the student may
	disagree with what his
	would-be teacher says about it, and the teacher himself is inconsistent in
	what he believes.” The Notes
	was originally written “about what he believes” but “about” was crossed out,
	and “in” written above the
	line.

	III‐30
	impossible. This is not an opinion but a fact. In order to judge
	anything rightly,74 one would have to be fully aware of an
	inconceivably wide range of things; past, present and to come. One
	would have to recognise in advance all the effects of his judgements
	on everyone and everything involved in them in any way. And one
	would have to be certain there is no distortion in his perception, so
	that his judgement would be wholly fair to everyone on whom it
	rests now and in the future. Who is in a position to do this? Who
	except in grandiose fantasies would claim this for himself?
	M 11 <em>a</em> 4. Remember how many times you thought you knew all the
	“facts” you needed for judgement, and how wrong you were! Is
	there anyone who has not had this experience? Would you know
	how many times you merely thought you were right, without ever
	realising you were wrong? Why would you choose such an
	arbitrary basis for decision‐making? Wisdom is not judgement; it is
	the relinquishment of judgement. Make then but one more
	judgement. It is this; there is Someone with you Whose judgement is
	perfect. He does know all the facts, past, present and to come. He
	does know all the effects of His judgement on everyone and
	everything involved in any way. And He is wholly fair to everyone,
	for there is no distortion in His perception. M(30)
	M 11 <em>a</em> 5. Therefore lay judgement down, not with regret but with a
	sigh of gratitude. Now are you free of a burden so great that you
	could merely stagger and fall down beneath it. And it was all
	illusion. Nothing more. Now can the teacher of God rise up
	unburdened, and walk lightly on. Yet it is not only this that is his
	benefit. His sense of care is gone, for he has none. He has given it
	away, along with judgement. He gave himself to Him Whose
	judgement he has chosen now to trust instead of his own. Now he
	makes no mistakes. His Guide is sure. And where he came to judge
	he comes to bless. Where now he laughs he used to come to weep.
	74 John 7:24 “Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous
	judgement.”
	1688 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐31
	M 11 <em>a</em> 6. It is not difficult to relinquish judgement. But it is
	difficult
	indeed to try to keep it. The teacher of God lays it down happily the
	instant he recognises its cost. All of the ugliness he sees75 about him
	is its outcome. All of the pain he looks upon is its result. All of the
	loneliness and sense of loss; of passing time and growing
	hopelessness; of sickening despair and fear of death; all these have
	come of it. And now he knows that these things need not be. Not
	one is true. For he has given up their cause, and they, which never
	were but the effects of his mistaken choice, have fallen from him.
	Teacher of God, this step will bring you peace. Can it be difficult to
	want but this?
	12. <em>how is peace possible in</em> THIS <em>world</em>?
	M 12 <em>a</em> 1. This is a question everyone must ask. Certainly peace
	seems to be impossible here.76 Yet the Word of God promises other
	things that seem impossible, as well as this. His Word has promised
	peace. It has also promised that there is no death; that resurrection
	must occur, and that rebirth is manʹs inheritance. The world you see
	cannot be the world God loves, and yet His Word assures us that He
	loves the world. Godʹs Word has promised us77 that peace is
	possible here, and what He promises can hardly be impossible. But
	it is true that the world must be looked at differently, if His
	promises are to be accepted. What the world is, is but a fact. You
	cannot choose what this should be. But you can choose how you
	would see it. Indeed, you must choose this. M(31)
	M 12 <em>a</em> 2. Again we come to the question of judgement. This time, ask
	yourself whether your judgement or the Word of God is more likely
	to be true. For they say different things about the world, and things
	so opposite that it is pointless to try to78 reconcile them. God offers
	75 Mark-up shifts the next two sentences to past tense. FIP does not preserve

	the world salvation; your judgement would condemn it. God says
	there is no death; your judgement sees but death as the inevitable end
	of life. Godʹs Word assures you that He loves the world; your
	judgement says it is unlovable. Who is right? For one of you is
	wrong. It must be so.
	M 12 <em>a</em> 3. The text explains that the Holy Spirit is the Answer to all
	problems you have made. These problems are not true,79 but that is
	meaningless to those who believe in them. And everyone believes
	in what he made, for it was made by his believing it. Into this
	strange and paradoxical situation, – one without meaning and
	devoid of sense, yet out of which no way seems possible, – God has
	sent His Judgement to answer yours. Gently His Judgement
	substitutes for yours. And through this substitution is the
	ununderstandable made understandable. How is peace possible in
	this world? In your judgement it is not possible, and can never be
	possible. But in the Judgement of God what is reflected here is only
	peace.
	M 12 <em>a</em> 4. Peace is impossible to those who look on war. Peace is
	inevitable to those who offer peace. How easily, then, is your
	judgement of the world escaped. It is not the world which makes
	peace seem impossible. It is the world you see that is impossible.
	Yet has Godʹs Judgement on this distorted world redeemed it and
	made it fit to welcome peace. And peace descends on it in joyous
	answer. Peace now belongs here, because a Thought of God has
	entered. What else but a Thought of God turns hell to Heaven
	merely by being what It is? The earth bows down before Its
	gracious Presence, and It leans down in answer to raise it up again.
	Now is the question different. It is no longer, “Can peace be
	possible in this world?” but instead, “Is it not impossible that peace
	be absent here?” M(32)

	13. <em>how</em> MANY <em>teachers of God</em> ARE NEEDED TO <em>save the</em>
	<em>world</em>?
	M 13 <em>a</em> 1. The80 answer to this question is “oneʺ. One wholly perfect
	teacher, whose learning is complete, suffices. This One, sanctified
	and redeemed, becomes the Self Who is the Son of God. He Who
	was always wholly spirit now no longer sees Himself as a body, or
	even as in a body. Therefore He is limitless. And being limitless,
	His Thoughts are joined with Godʹs forever and ever. His
	perception of Himself is based upon Godʹs Judgement, not His Own.
	Thus does He share Godʹs Will, and bring His Thoughts to still
	deluded minds. He is forever One, because He is as God created
	Him. He has accepted Christ and He is saved.81
	M 13 <em>a</em> 2. Thus does the son of man become the Son of God.82 It is
	not really a change; it is a change of mind. Nothing external alters,
	but everything internal now reflects only the Love of God. God can
	no longer be feared, for the mind sees no cause for punishment.
	Godʹs teachers appear to be many, for that is the worldʹs need. Yet
	being joined in one purpose, and one they share with God, how
	could they be separate from each other? What does it matter if they
	then appear in many forms? Their minds are one; their joining is
	complete. And God works through them now as One, for that is
	what they are.
	M 13 <em>a</em> 3. Why is the illusion of many necessary? Only because
	reality is not understandable to the deluded. Only a very few can
	hear God’s Voice at all, and even they cannot communicate His
	messages directly through the Spirit Which gave them. They need a

	82 Matthew 8:20 Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have

	uses to refer to himself
	and people in general in the Gospels, and this phrase in the Course appears to
	harken to the Gospels.

	would find83 in them. Do not forget that truth can come only where
	it is welcomed without fear. So do God’s teachers need a body, for
	their Unity could not be recognised directly. M(33)
	M 13 <em>a</em> 4. Yet what makes them84 God’s teachers is their recognition
	of the proper purpose of the body. As they advance in their
	profession, they become more and more certain that the body’s
	function is but to let God’s Voice speak through it to human ears.
	And these ears will carry to the mind of the hearer messages which85
	are not of this world, and the mind will understand because of their
	Source. From this understanding will come the recognition, in this
	new teacher of God, of what the body’s purpose really is; the only
	use there really is for it. This lesson is enough to let the Thought of
	Unity come in, and what is One is recognised as One. The teachers
	of God appear to share the illusion of separation, but because of
	what they use the body for, they do not believe in the illusion
	despite appearances.
	M 13 <em>a</em> 5. The central lesson is always this; that what you use the
	body for, it will become to you. Use it for sin or for attack, which is
	the same as sin, and you will see it as sinful. Because it is sinful it is
	weak, and being weak it suffers and it dies. Use it to bring the Word
	of God to those who have It86 not, and the body becomes holy.
	Because it is holy it cannot be sick, nor can it die. When its
	usefulness is done it is laid by, and that is all. The mind makes this
	decision, as it makes all decisions which87 are responsible for the
	body’s condition. Yet the teacher of God does not make this
	decision alone. To do that would be to give the body another
	purpose from the one that keeps it holy. God’s Voice will tell him
	when he has fulfilled his role, just as It tells him what his function is.

	He does not suffer either in going or remaining. Sickness is now
	impossible to him.
	M 13 <em>a</em> 6. Oneness and sickness cannot co‐exist. Godʹs teachers
	choose to look on dreams a while. It is a conscious choice. For they
	have learned that all choices are made consciously, with full
	awareness of their consequences. The dream says otherwise, but
	who would put his faith in dreams, once they are recognised for
	what they are? Awareness of dreaming is the real function of Godʹs
	teachers. They watch the dream figures come and go, shift and
	change, suffer and die. Yet they are not deceived by what they see.
	They recognise that to behold a dream figure as sick and separate is
	no more real than to regard it as healthy and beautiful. M(34) Unity
	alone is not a thing of dreams. And it is this Godʹs teachers
	acknowledge as behind the dream, beyond all seeing and yet surely
	theirs.
	14. <em>what is the</em> REAL <em>meaning of</em> <em>sacrifice</em>?
	M 14 <em>a</em> 1. Although in truth the term sacrifice is altogether
	meaningless, it does have meaning in the world. Like all things in
	the world its meaning is temporary, and will ultimately fade into
	the nothingness from which it came when there is no more use for it.
	Now its real meaning is a lesson. Like all lessons it is an illusion, for
	in reality there is nothing to learn. Yet this illusion must be replaced
	by a corrective device; another illusion that replaces the first, so both
	can finally disappear. The first illusion, which must be displaced
	before another thought system can take hold, is that it is a sacrifice
	to give up the things of this world. What could this be but an
	illusion, since this world itself is nothing more than that?
	M 14 <em>a</em> 2. It takes great learning both to realise and to accept the
	fact
	that the world has nothing to give. What can the sacrifice of nothing
	mean? It cannot mean that you have less because of it. There is no
	sacrifice in the worldʹs terms that does not involve the body. Think
	a while about what the world calls sacrifice. Power, fame, money,
	physical pleasure; who is the hero to whom all these things belong?
	1693 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐36
	Could they mean anything except to a body? Yet a body cannot
	evaluate. By seeking after such things the mind associates itself
	with the body, obscuring its identity and losing sight of what it
	really is. M(35)
	M 14 <em>a</em> 3. Once this confusion has occurred, it becomes impossible for
	the mind to understand that all the “pleasures” of the world are
	nothing. But what a sacrifice,‐ and it is sacrifice indeed88 ‐ all this
	entails! Now has the mind condemned itself to seek without
	finding89; to be forever dissatisfied and discontented; to know not
	what it really wants to find. Who can escape this selfcondemnation?
	Only through God’s Word could this be possible.
	For self‐condemnation is a decision about identity, and no‐one
	doubts what he believes he is. He can doubt all things, but never
	this.
	M 14 <em>a</em> 4. God’s teachers can have no regret on giving up the
	pleasures of the world. Is it a sacrifice to give up pain? Does an
	adult resent the giving up of children’s toys? Does one whose
	vision has already glimpsed the Face of Christ look back with
	longing on a slaughter house? No‐one who has escaped the world
	and all its ills looks back on it with condemnation. Yet he must
	rejoice that he is free of all the sacrifice which90 its values91 would
	demand of him. To them he sacrifices all his freedom.92 To them he
	sacrifices all his peace.93 And to possess them must he sacrifice his
	hope of Heaven and remembrance of his Father’s Love. Who in his
	sane mind chooses nothing as a substitute for everything?
	M 14 <em>a</em> 5. What is the real meaning of sacrifice? It is the cost of
	believing in illusions. It is the price that must be paid for the denial
	88 FIP puts exclamation point here. The Notes does not.
	89 Matthew 7:7-8 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be
	opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to
	him who knocks it will
	be opened.”
	90 FIP omits “which” but it is present in the Notes.
	91 FIP changes the manuscript “sacrifice its value” to “sacrifice its values”
	which is the reading in the
	Notes.
	92 FIP has “peace” instead of “freedom.” The Notes has “freedom.”

	of truth. There is no pleasure of the world that does not demand
	this, for otherwise the pleasure would be seen as pain. And no‐one
	asks for pain if he recognises it. It is the idea of sacrifice that makes
	him blind. He does not see what he is asking for. And so he seeks it
	in a thousand ways and in a thousand places, each time believing it
	is there and each time disappointed in the end. “Seek but do not
	find94” remains this world’s stern decree, and no‐one who pursues
	the world’s goals can do otherwise. M(36)
	M 14 <em>a</em> 6. You may believe this course requires sacrifice of all you
	really hold dear. In one sense that95 is true, for you hold dear the
	things that crucify God’s Son. And it is the course’s aim to set him
	free. But do not be mistaken about what sacrifice means. It always
	means the giving up of what you want. And what, oh teacher of
	God, is it that you want? You have been called by God, and you
	have answered. Would you now sacrifice that Call? Few have
	heard it as yet, and they can but turn to you. There is no other hope
	in all the world that they can trust. There is no other voice in all the
	world that echoes God’s. If you would sacrifice the truth, they stay
	in hell. And if they stay, you will remain with them.
	M 14 <em>a</em> 7. Do not forget that sacrifice is total. There are no “half
	sacrifices.” You cannot give up Heaven partially. You cannot be a
	little bit in hell. The Word of God has no exceptions. It is this that
	makes It holy and beyond the world. It is Its holiness that points to
	God. It is Its holiness that makes you safe. It is denied if you attack
	any brother for anything. For it is here the split with God occurs. A
	split that is impossible. A split that cannot happen. Yet a split in
	which you surely will believe, because you have set up a situation
	that is impossible. And in this situation the impossible can seem to
	happen. It seems to happen at the “sacrifice” of truth.
	M 14 <em>a</em> 8. Teacher of God, do not forget the meaning of sacrifice, and
	94 Matthew 7:7-8 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be
	opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to
	him who knocks it will
	be opened.”

	remember what each decision you make must mean in terms of cost.
	Decide for God, and everything is given you at no cost at all. Decide
	against Him and you choose nothing at the expense of the
	awareness of everything. What would you teach? Remember only
	what you would learn. For it is here that your concern should be.
	Atonement is for you. Your learning claims it and your learning
	gives it. The world contains it not, but learn this course and it is
	yours. God holds out His Word to you, for He has need of teachers.
	What other way is there to save His Son? M(37)
	15. <em>how will the world end</em>?
	M 15 <em>a</em> 1. Can what has no beginning really end? The world will end
	in an illusion, as it began. Yet will its ending be an illusion of
	mercy. The illusion of forgiveness, complete, excluding no‐one,
	limitless in gentleness, will cover it, hiding all evil, concealing all sin
	and ending guilt forever. So ends the world that guilt had made, for
	now it has no purpose and is gone. The father of illusions is the
	belief that they have a purpose; that they serve a need or gratify a
	want. Perceived as purposeless, they are no longer seen. Their
	uselessness is recognised and they are gone. How but in this way
	are all illusions ended? They have been brought to truth, and truth
	saw them not. It merely overlooked the meaningless.
	M 15 <em>a</em> 2. Until forgiveness is complete, the world does have a
	purpose. It becomes the home in which forgiveness is born, and
	where it grows and becomes stronger and more all embracing. Here
	is it nourished, for here it is needed. A gentle Saviour, born where sin
	was made and guilt seemed real. Here is His home, for here there is
	need of Him indeed. He brings the ending of the world with Him.
	It is His Call Godʹs teachers answer, turning to Him in silence to
	receive His Word. The world will end when all things in it have
	been rightly judged by His judgement. The world will end with the
	benediction of holiness upon it. When not one thought of sin
	remains, the world is over. It will not be destroyed nor attacked nor
	even touched. It will merely cease to seem to be.
	1696 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐39
	M 15 <em>a</em> 3. Certainly this seems to be a long, long while away. “When
	not one thought of sin remains” appears to be a long‐range goal
	indeed. But time stands still, and waits on the goals96 of Godʹs
	teachers. Not one thought of sin will remain the instant any one of
	them accepts the97 Atonement for himself. It is not easier to forgive
	one sin than to forgive all of them. The illusion of orders of
	difficulty is an obstacle the teacher of God must learn to pass by and
	leave behind. One sin perfectly forgiven by one teacher of God can
	make salvation complete. Can you understand this? No; it is
	meaningless to anyone here. Yet it is the final lesson M(38) in which
	Unity is restored. It goes against all the thinking of the world, but
	so98 does Heaven.
	M 15 <em>a</em> 4. The world will end when its thought system has been
	completely reversed. Until then, bits and pieces of its thinking will
	still seem sensible. The final lesson which brings the ending of the
	world cannot be grasped by those not yet prepared to leave the
	world and go beyond its tiny reach. What, then, is the function of
	the teacher of God in this concluding lesson? He need merely learn
	how to approach it; to be willing to go in its direction. He need
	merely trust that, if God’s Voice tells him it is a lesson he can learn,
	he can learn it. He does not judge it either as hard or easy. His
	Teacher points to it, and he trusts that He will show him how to
	learn it.
	M 15 <em>a</em> 5. The world will end in joy because it is a place of sorrow.
	When joy has come the purpose of the world has gone. The world
	will end in peace because it is a place of war. When peace has come,
	what is the purpose of the world? The world will end in laughter
	because it is a place of tears. Where there is laughter, who can99

	longer weep? And only complete forgiveness brings all this to bless
	the world. In blessing it departs, for it will not end as it began. To
	turn hell into Heaven is the function of God’s teachers, for what
	they teach are lessons in which Heaven is reflected. And now sit
	down in true humility, and realise that all God would have you do
	you can do. Do not be arrogant and say you cannot learn His Own
	curriculum. His Word says otherwise. His Will be done. It cannot
	be otherwise. And be you thankful it is so. M(39)
	16. <em>is each one</em> TO BE JUDGED <em>in the end</em>?
	M 16 <em>a</em> 1. Indeed,100 yes! No‐one can escape God’s final judgement.
	Who could flee forever from the truth? But the final judgement will
	not come until it is no longer associated with fear. One day each
	one will welcome it, and on that very day it will be given him. He
	will hear his sinlessness proclaimed around and around the world,
	setting it free as God’s final judgement on him is received. This is the
	judgement in which salvation lies. This is the judgement that will set
	him free. This is the judgement in which all things are freed with
	him. Time pauses as eternity comes near, and silence lies across the
	world that everyone may hear this judgement of the Son of God:
	ʺHoly are you, eternal, free and whole,
	At peace forever in the Heart of God.
	Where is the world, and where is sorrow now?ʺ
	M 16 <em>a</em> 2. Is this your judgement on yourself, teacher of God? Do you
	believe that this is wholly true? No, not yet, not yet. But this is still
	your goal; why you are here. It is your function to prepare yourself
	to hear this judgement and to recognise that it is true. One instant of
	complete belief in this, and you will go beyond belief to Certainty.
	One instant out of time can bring time’s end. Judge not, for you but
	judge yourself101 and thus delay this final judgement. What is your
	judgement on102 the world, teacher of God? Have you yet learned to
	stand aside and hear the Voice of Judgement in yourself? Or do you

	still attempt to take His role from Him? Learn to be quiet, for His
	Voice is heard in stillness. And His Judgement comes to all who
	stand aside in quiet listening, and wait for Him. M(40)
	M 16 <em>a</em> 3. You who are sometimes sad and sometimes angry; who
	sometimes feel your just due is not given you, and your best efforts
	meet with lack of appreciation and even with103 contempt; give up
	these foolish thoughts.104 They are too small and meaningless to
	occupy your holy minds105 an instant longer. God’s Judgement waits
	for you to set you free. What can the world hold out to you,
	regardless of your judgements on its gifts, that you would rather
	have? You will be judged, and judged in fairness and in honesty.
	There is no deceit in God. His promises are sure. Only remember
	that. His promises have guaranteed His judgement, and His alone,
	will be accepted in the end. It is your function to make that end be
	soon. It is your function to hold it in106 your heart, and offer it to all
	the world to keep it safe.
	17. <em>how</em> SHOULD <em>the</em> TEACHER <em>of God</em> SPEND HIS DAY?
	M 17 <em>a</em> 1. To the advanced teacher of God this question is
	meaningless. There is no program, for the lessons in the
	curriculum107 change each day. Yet he108 is sure of but one thing;
	they do not change at random. Seeing this, and understanding it is
	true, he rests content. He will be told all that his role should be, this
	day and every day. And those who share that role with him will
	find him, so they can learn the lessons for the day together. Not one
	is absent whom he needs; not one is sent without a learning goal
	already set, and one which can be met109 that very day. For the
	advanced teacher of God, then, this question is superfluous. It has

	parentheses. The Notes has it

	as it stands here.

	been asked and answered, and he keeps in constant contact with the
	Answer. He is set, and110 sees the road on which he walks stretch
	surely and smoothly before him.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 2. But what about those who have not reached his certainty?
	They are not yet ready for such lack of structuring on their own
	part. What must they do to learn to give the day to God? There are
	some general rules which do apply, although each one must use
	them as best he can in his own way. Routines as such are
	dangerous, because they easily become gods in their own right,
	threatening the very goals for which they were set up. Broadly
	speaking, then, it can be said M(41) that it is well to start the day
	right. It is always possible to begin again, should the day begin with
	error. Yet there are obvious advantages in terms of saving time if
	the need for this can be avoided.111
	M 17 <em>a</em> 3. At the beginning it is wise to think in terms of time. This
	is
	by no means the ultimate criterion, but at the outset it is probably
	the simplest to observe. The saving of time112 is an essential early
	emphasis which, although it remains important throughout the
	learning process, becomes less and less <em>emphasised</em>. At the outset,
	we can safely say that time devoted to starting the day right does
	indeed save time. How much time should be so spent? This must
	depend on the teacher of God himself. He cannot claim that title
	until he has gone through the Workbook, since we are learning
	within the framework of our course. After completion of the more
	structured practice periods which the Workbook contains,
	individual need becomes the chief consideration.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 4. This course is always practical. It may be that the teacher
	of God is not in a situation which113 fosters quiet thought as he
	110 Urtext manuscript doesn’t have “and”, it is handwritten in. FIP preserves
	it. It is also present in the

	present in the Notes.
	112 The Manuscript says “the saving of the mind” and FIP changes that to “the
	saving of time” which
	corrects the passage to conform to its original form in the Notes. We’re
	viewing this as a copying
	mistake in the Urtext manuscript and incorporating this correction.

	awakes. If this is so, let him but remember that he chooses to spend
	time with God as soon as possible, and let him do so. Duration is
	not the major concern. One can easily sit still an hour with closed
	eyes, and accomplish nothing. One can as easily give God only an
	instant, and in that instant join with Him completely. Perhaps the
	one generalisation that can be made is this; as soon as possible after
	waking take your quiet time, continuing a minute or two after you
	begin to find it difficult. You may find that the difficulty will
	diminish and drop away. If not, that is the time to stop.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 5. The same procedures should be followed at night. Perhaps
	your quiet time should be fairly early in the evening, if it is not
	feasible for you to take it just before going to sleep. It is not wise to
	lie down for it. It is better to sit up, in whatever position you prefer.
	Having gone through the Workbook you must have come to some
	conclusions in this respect. If possible, M(42) however, just before
	sleeping114 is a desirable time to devote to God. It sets your mind
	into a pattern of rest, and orients you away from fear. If it is
	expedient to spend this time earlier, at least be sure that you do not
	forget a brief period,‐ not more than a moment will do,‐ in which
	you close your eyes and think of God.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 6. There is one thought in particular that should be
	remembered throughout the day. It is a thought of pure joy; a
	thought of peace, a thought of limitless release, ‐ limitless because
	all things are freed within it. You think you made a place of safety
	for yourself. You think you made a power that can save you from
	all the fearful things you see in dreams. It is not so. Your safety lies
	not there. What you give up is merely the illusion of protecting
	illusions. And it is this you fear, and only this. How foolish to be so
	afraid of nothing! Nothing at all! Your defences will not work, but
	you are not in danger. You have no need of them. Recognize this
	and they will disappear. And only then will you accept your real
	protection.

	M 17 <em>a</em> 7. How simply and how easily does time115 slip by for the
	teacher of God who has accepted His protection! All that he did
	before in the name of safety no longer interests him. For he is safe,
	and knows it to be116 so. He has a Guide Who will not fail. He need
	make no distinctions among the problems he perceives, for He to
	Whom he turns with all of them recognises no order of difficulty in
	resolving them. He is as safe in the present as he was before
	illusions were accepted into his mind, and as he will be when he has
	let them go. There is no difference in his state at different times and
	different places, because they are all one to God. This is his safety.
	And he has no need for more than this.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 8. Yet there will be temptations along the way the teacher of
	God has yet to travel, and he has need of reminding himself
	throughout the day of his protection. How can he do this,
	particularly during the time when his mind is occupied with
	external things? He can but try, and his success depends on his
	conviction that he will succeed. He must be sure success is not of
	him, but will be given him at any M(43) time, in any place and
	circumstance he calls for it. There are times his certainty will waver,
	and the instant this occurs he will return to earlier attempts to place
	reliance on himself alone. Forget not this is magic, and that117 magic
	is a sorry substitute for true assistance. It is not good enough for
	God’s teacher because it is not good118 enough for God’s Son.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 9. The avoidance of magic is the avoidance of temptation. For
	all temptation is nothing more than the attempt to substitute

	sacrifice, healing nor destructive, quieting nor fearful. When all
	magic is recognised as merely nothing, the teacher of God has
	reached the most advanced state. All intermediate lessons will but
	lead to this, and bring this goal nearer to recognition. For magic of
	any kind, in all its forms,120 simply does nothing. Its powerlessness
	is the reason it can be so easily escaped. What has no effects can
	hardly terrify.
	M 17 <em>a</em> 10. There is no substitute for the Will of God. In simple
	statement, it is to this121 fact that the teacher of God devotes his day.
	Each substitute he may accept as real can but deceive him. But he is
	safe from all deception if he so decides. Perhaps he needs to
	remember “God is with me. I cannot be deceived.” Perhaps he
	prefers other words, or only one or none at all. Yet each temptation
	to accept magic as true must be abandoned through his recognition
	not that it is fearful, not that it is sinful, not that it is dangerous, but
	merely that it is meaningless. Rooted in sacrifice and separation,
	two aspects of one error and no more, he merely chooses to give up
	all that he never had. And for this “sacrifice” is Heaven restored to
	his awareness. M(44)
	M 17 <em>a</em> 11. Is not this an exchange that you would want? The world
	would gladly make it, if it knew it could be made. It is Godʹs
	teachers who must teach it that it can. And so it is their function to
	make sure that they have learned it. No risk is possible throughout
	the day except to put your trust in magic, for it is only this that leads
	to pain. “There is no will but Godʹs.” His teachers know that this is
	so, and have learned that everything but this is magic. All belief in
	magic is maintained by just one simple‐minded illusion; – that it
	works. All through his training, every day and hour, and even
	every minute and second, must Godʹs teachers learn to recognise the
	forms of magic and perceive their meaninglessness. Fear is

	withdrawn from them and so they go. And thus the Gate of Heaven
	is reopened, and its light can shine again on an untroubled mind.
	18. <em>how</em> DO <em>God</em>’S <em>teachers</em> DEAL <em>with their</em>
	PUPILS’
	THOUGHTS <em>of</em> MAGIC?
	M 18 <em>a</em> 1. This is a crucial question both for teacher and pupil.122
	If
	this issue is mishandled, the teacher of God has hurt himself and has
	also attacked his pupil. This strengthens fear and makes the magic
	seem quite real to both of them. How to deal with magic thus
	becomes a major lesson for the teacher of God to master. His first
	responsibility in this is not to attack it. If a magic thought arouses
	anger in any form, Godʹs teacher123 can be sure that he is
	strengthening his own belief in sin and has condemned himself. He
	can be sure as well that he has asked for depression, pain, fear and
	disaster to come to him. Let him remember, then, it is not this that
	he would teach because it is not this that he would learn.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 2. There is, however, a temptation to respond to magic in a
	way that reïnforces it. Nor is this always obvious. It can, in fact, be
	easily concealed beneath a wish to help. It is this double wish that
	makes the help of little value, and must lead to undesired outcomes.
	Nor should it be forgotten that the outcome that124 results will
	always come to teacher and to pupil.125 How many times has it been
	<em>emphasised</em> that you give but to yourself? And where could this be
	better shown than in the kinds of help the teacher gives to those
	who need his aid? Here is his gift M(45) most clearly given him. For
	he will give only what he has chosen for himself. And in this gift is
	his judgement upon the holy Son of God.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 3. It is easiest to let error be corrected where it is most
	apparent, and errors can be recognised by their results. A lesson
	122 Urtext manuscript has “student” crossed out, and “pupil” penciled in. It
	is “pupil” in the Notes.
	123 Urtext manuscript has the plural, “teachers” here. The Notes uses an
	abbreviation which could be
	read as either. The singular works better in the context, since the following
	pronoun “he” refers back to
	this word and if it were plural, the pronoun would be “they.”
	124 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change the originally typed “which” to “that”
	which corrects the
	passage to conform to the Notes.
	125 FIP inserts here “alike.” That word is not present in the Notes.
	1704 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐47
	truly taught can lead to nothing but release for teacher and pupil,
	who have shared in one intent. Attack can enter only if perception
	of separate goals has entered. And this must indeed have been the
	case if the result is anything but joy. The single aim of the teacher
	turns the divided goal of the pupil into one direction, with the call
	for help becoming his one appeal. This then is easily responded to
	with just one answer, and this answer will enter the teacher’s mind
	unfailingly. From there it shines into his pupil’s mind, making it
	one with his.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 4. Perhaps it will be helpful to remember that no‐one can be
	angry at a fact. It is always an interpretation that gives rise to
	negative emotions, regardless of their seeming justification by what
	appear as facts.126 Regardless, too, of the intensity of the anger
	which127 is aroused. It may be merely slight irritation, perhaps too
	mild to be even clearly recognised. Or it may also take the form of
	intense rage, accompanied by thoughts of violence, fantasied or
	apparently acted out. It does not matter. All of these reäctions are
	the same. They obscure the truth, and this can never be a matter of
	degree. Either truth is apparent or it is not. It cannot be partially
	recognised. Who is unaware of truth must look upon128 illusions.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 5. Anger in response to perceived magic thoughts is a129 basic
	cause of fear. Consider what this reäction means, and its centrality
	in the world’s thought system becomes apparent. A magic thought,
	by its mere presence, acknowledges a separation from God. It
	states, in the clearest form possible, that the mind which thinks it130
	126 Urtext manuscript has “appears as facts,” FIP emphasises the word
	“appears” and has “appears as
	facts.” The Notes has “is seen as facts.” There is a grammar problem with
	“what appears as facts.”
	Either “appears as fact” or “appear as facts” work, but “appears as facts”
	does not. This is a tricky
	sentence to parse, but “appears” is a verb and the subject of that verb is the
	facts which are appearing.
	If there is more than one fact, then they appear. If there is only one then it
	appears.
	127 FIP changes “which” to “that” but it is “which” in the Notes.
	128 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change the originally typed “see” to “look
	upon” which is also the
	reading in the Notes.
	129 The Urtext manuscript has the word “the” typed in above “a” in “a basic
	cause.” FIP makes it “a
	basic cause” as does the Notes.
	130 FIP omits “thinks it” so the sentence becomes “the mind which believes.”
	The Notes has it as it is
	here.
	1705 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐48
	believes it has a separate will that can oppose the Will of God and
	succeed. That this can hardly be a fact is obvious. Yet that it can be
	believed as fact is surely so.131 And herein lies the birthplace of
	guilt. Who usurps the place of God and takes it for himself now has
	a deadly “enemy.” And he must stand alone in his protection, and
	make himself a shield to keep him safe from fury that can never be
	abated and vengeance that can never be satisfied. M(46)
	M 18 <em>a</em> 6. How can this unfair battle be resolved? Its ending is
	inevitable, for its outcome must be death. How then can one believe
	in oneʹs defences? Magic again must help. Forget the battle. Accept
	it as a fact and then forget it. Do not remember the impossible odds
	against you. Do not remember the immensity of the “enemy,” and
	do not think about your frailty in comparison. Accept your
	separation, but do not remember how it came about. Believe that
	you have won it, but do not retain the slightest memory of Who
	your great “opponent” really is. Projecting your “forgetting” onto
	Him, it seems to you He has forgotten, too.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 7. But what will now be your reäction to all magic thoughts?
	They can but reawaken sleeping guilt, which you have hidden but
	have not let go. Each one says clearly to your frightened mind,
	“You have usurped the place of God. Think not He has forgotten.”
	Here we have the fear of God most starkly represented. For in that
	thought has guilt already raised madness to the throne of God
	Himself. And now there is no hope. Except132 to kill. Here is
	salvation now. An angry Father pursues His guilty Son. Kill or be
	killed, for here alone is choice. Beyond this there is none, for what
	was done cannot be done without. The stain of blood can never be
	removed, and anyone who bears this stain on him must meet with
	death.
	M 18 <em>a</em> 8. Into this hopeless situation God sends His teachers. They
	bring the light of hope from God Himself. There is a Way in which
	escape is possible. It can be learned and taught, but it requires
	131 FIP replaces “so” with “obvious.” The Notes has “so.”
	132 The Urtext manuscript also has “accept” instead of “except.” The Notes has
	“Except.”
	1706 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐49
	patience and abundant willingness. Given that, the lesson’s
	manifest simplicity stands out like an intense white light against a
	black horizon, for such it is. If anger comes from an interpretation
	and not a fact, it is never justified. Once this is even dimly grasped,
	the Way is open. Now it is possible to take the next step. The
	interpretation can be changed at last. Magic thoughts need not lead
	to condemnation, for they do not really have the power to give rise
	to guilt. And so they can be overlooked, and thus forgiven133 in the
	truest sense. M(47)
	M 18 <em>a</em> 9. Madness but seems terrible. In truth it has no power to
	make anything. Like the magic which becomes its servant, it neither
	attacks nor protects. To see it and to recognise its thought system is
	to look on nothing. Can nothing give rise to anger? Hardly so.
	Remember then, teacher of God, that anger recognises a reality that
	is not there; yet is the anger certain witness that you do believe in it
	as fact. Now is escape impossible until you see you have responded
	to your own interpretation, which you have projected on an outside
	world. Let this grim sword be taken from you now. There is no
	death.134 This sword does not exist. The fear of God is causeless.
	But His Love is Cause of everything beyond all fear, and thus
	forever real and always true.
	19. <em>how is</em> CORRECTION MADE?
	M 19 <em>a</em> 1. Correction of a lasting nature, – and only this is true
	correction, – cannot be made until the teacher of God has ceased to
	confuse interpretation with fact, or illusion with truth. If he argues
	with his pupil about a magic thought, attacks it, tries to establish its
	error or demonstrate its falsity, he is but witnessing to its reality.
	Depression is then inevitable, for he has “proved” both to his pupil
	and himself that it is their task to escape from what is real. And this
	can only be impossible. Reality is changeless. Magic thoughts are
	but illusions. Otherwise salvation would be only the same age old
	133 FIP replaces “forgiven” with “forgotten”!! The Notes has “forgiven.”
	134 2 Timothy 1:10 But has now been revealed by the appearing of our Saviour
	Jesus Christ, who has
	abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

	III‐50
	impossible dream in but another form. Yet the dream of salvation
	has new content. It is not the form alone in which the difference
	lies.
	M 19 <em>a</em> 2. Godʹs teachersʹ major lesson is to learn how to reäct to
	magic thoughts wholly without anger. Only in this way can they
	proclaim the truth about themselves. Through them, the Holy Spirit
	can now speak of the reality of the Son of God. Now He can remind
	the world of sinlessness, the one unchanged, unchangeable
	condition of all that God created. Now He can speak the Word of
	God to listening ears, and bring Christʹs vision to eyes that see.
	Now is He free to teach all minds the truth of what they are, so they
	will gladly be returned to Him. And now is guilt forgiven,
	overlooked completely in His sight and in Godʹs Word. M(48)
	M 19 <em>a</em> 3. Anger but screeches, “Guilt is real!” Reality is blotted135
	out
	as this insane belief is taken as replacement for Godʹs Word. The
	bodyʹs eyes now “see”; its ears alone are thought to136 hear. Its little
	space and tiny breath become the measure of reality. And truth
	becomes diminutive and meaningless. Correction has one answer to
	all this, and to the world that rests on this:
	ʺYou but mistake interpretation for the truth. And you are . wrong.
	But a mistake is not a sin, nor has reality been taken . from its throne
	by your mistakes. God reigns forever, and His . laws alone prevail
	upon you and upon the world. His Love .
	remains the only thing there is. Fear is illusion, for you are like
	Him.ʺ
	M 19 <em>a</em> 4. In order to heal, it thus becomes essential for the teacher
	of
	God to let all his own mistakes be corrected. If he senses even the
	faintest hint of irritation in himself as he responds to anyone, let him
	instantly realise that he has made an interpretation which is not
	true. Then let him turn within to his Eternal Guide, and let Him
	Judge what the response should be. So is he healed, and in his

	III‐51
	healing is his pupil healed with him. The sole responsibility of
	Godʹs teacher is to accept the Atonement for himself. Atonement
	means correction, or the undoing of errors. When this has been
	accomplished, the teacher of God becomes a miracle worker by
	definition. His sins have been forgiven him, and he no longer
	condemns himself. How can he then condemn anyone? And who is
	there whom his forgiveness can fail to heal?ʺ
	20. <em>what is</em> JUSTICE?
	M 20 <em>a</em> 1. Justice is the divine correction for injustice. Injustice
	is the
	basis for all the judgements of the world. Justice corrects the
	interpretations to which injustice gives rise, and cancels them out.
	Neither justice nor injustice exists in Heaven, for error is impossible
	and correction meaningless. In this world, however, forgiveness
	depends on justice, since all attack can only be unjust. Justice is the
	Holy Spiritʹs verdict upon the world. Except in His judgement justice
	is M(49) impossible, for no‐one in the world is capable of making
	only just interpretations and laying all injustices aside. If God’s Son
	were fairly judged, there would be no need for salvation. The
	thought of separation would have been forever inconceivable.
	M 20 <em>a</em> 2. Justice, like its opposite, is an interpretation. It is,
	however,
	the one interpretation that leads to truth. This becomes possible
	because, while it is not true in itself, justice includes nothing that
	opposes truth. There is no inherent conflict between justice and
	truth; one is but the first small step in the direction of the other. The
	path becomes quite different as one goes along. Nor could all the
	magnificence, the grandeur of the scene and the enormous opening
	vistas that rise to meet one as he travels on,137 be foretold from the
	outset. Yet even these, whose splendor reaches indescribable
	heights as one proceeds, fall short indeed of all that awaits one138
	137 FIP replaces “he travels on” with “the journey continues.” The Notes has
	“he travels on.”
	138 Urtext manuscript has “waits”. Handwritten mark-up suggests “awaits one”,
	although it is possible
	that the handwritten mark-up indicates “’waits” (contraction of “awaits”). FIP
	changes “waits” to
	“wait” viewing “all” as plural, (possibly) which it can be, but isn’t
	necessarily. One can have “all is
	well” as well as “all are well.” The Notes has “awaits one.”
	1709 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐52
	when the pathway ceases and time ends with it. But somewhere
	one must start. Justice is the beginning.
	M 20 <em>a</em> 3. All concepts of your brothers and yourself; all fears of
	future states and all concern139 about the past stem from injustice.
	Here is the lens which, held before the body’s eyes, distorts
	perception and brings witness of the distorted world back to the
	mind that made the lens and holds it very dear. Selectively and
	arbitrarily is every concept of the world built up in140 just this way.
	“Sins” are perceived and justified by this141 careful selectivity in
	which all thought of wholeness must be lost. Forgiveness has no
	place in such a scheme, for not one “sin” but seems forever true.
	M 20 <em>a</em> 4. Salvation is God’s justice. It restores to your awareness
	the
	wholeness of the fragments you perceive as broken off and separate.
	And it is this that overcomes the fear of death.142 For separate
	fragments must decay and die, but wholeness is immortal. It
	remains forever and forever like its Creator, being one with Him.
	God’s Judgement is His justice. Onto this, – a judgement wholly
	lacking in condemnation; an evaluation based entirely on love, –
	you have projected your injustice, giving143 God the lens of warped
	perception through which you look. Now it belongs to Him and not
	to you. You are afraid of Him, and do not see you hate and fear
	your Self as enemy. M(50)
	M 20 <em>a</em> 5. Pray for Godʹs justice, and do not confuse His mercy with
	your own insanity. Perception can make whatever picture the mind
	desires to see. Remember this. In this lies either Heaven or hell, as
	you elect. Godʹs justice points to Heaven just because it is entirely
	impartial. It accepts all evidence that is brought before it, omitting
	nothing and assessing nothing as separate and apart from all the
	139 FIP pluralizes “concern” making it “concerns”. That is also what the Notes
	has.

	141 FIP omits “this” as does the Notes.
	142 Urtext manuscript and FIP and the Notes all put a sentence break here
	needlessly, rendering the
	following clause into an incomplete sentence.

	with “giving God” while

	rest. From this one standpoint does it judge, and this alone. Here
	all attack and condemnation become144 meaningless and
	indefensible. Perception rests, the mind is still, and light returns
	again. Vision is now restored. What had been lost has now been
	found.145 The peace of God descends on all the world, and we can
	see. And we can see!
	21. <em>what is the peace of</em> GOD146?
	M 21 <em>a</em> 1. It has been said that there is a kind of peace that is not
	of
	this world.147 How is it recognised? How is it found? And being
	found, how can it be retained? Let us consider each of these
	questions separately, for each reflects a different step along the way.
	M 21 <em>a</em> 2. First, how can the peace of God be recognised? Godʹs
	peace is recognised at first by just one thing; in every way it is
	totally unlike all previous experiences. It calls to mind nothing that
	went before. It brings with it no past associations. It is a new thing
	entirely. There is a contrast, yes, between this thing and all the past.
	But strangely, it is not a contrast of true differences. The past just
	slips away, and in its place is everlasting quiet. Only that. The
	contrast first perceived has148 merely gone. Quiet has reached to
	cover everything.
	M 21 <em>a</em> 3. How is this quiet found? No‐one can fail to find it who but
	seeks out its conditions. God’s peace can never come where anger
	is, for anger must deny that peace exists.149 Who sees anger as
	justified in any way or any circumstance proclaims that peace is
	144 FIP changes “become” to “becomes.” The subject is “attack and
	condemnation” which is plural so
	the Urtext is correct. The Notes has an abbreviation “bec.” which could be
	either.
	145 Luke 15:24 “For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and
	is found.” And they began

	shall guard your hearts
	and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.”

	world gives do I give to you.
	Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”

	which is the reading in the

	meaningless, and must believe that it cannot exist. In this condition,
	peace cannot be found. Therefore, forgiveness is the necessary
	condition for finding the peace of God. More than this, given
	forgiveness there must be peace. For what except attack will lead to
	war? And what but peace is opposite to war? Here the initial
	contrast stands out clear and apparent. Yet when peace is found,
	the war M(51) is meaningless. And it is conflict now that is perceived
	as non‐existent and unreal.
	M 21 <em>a</em> 4. How is the peace of God retained, once it is found?
	Returning anger, in whatever form, will drop the heavy curtain once
	again, and the belief that peace cannot exist will certainly return.
	War is again accepted as the one reality. Now must you once again
	lay down your sword, although you will150 not recognise that you
	have picked it up again. But you will learn, as you remember even
	faintly now what happiness was yours without it, that you must
	have taken it again as your defence. Stop for a moment now and
	think of this: Is conflict what you want, or is God’s peace the better
	choice? Which gives you more? A tranquil mind is not a little gift.
	Would you not rather live than choose to die?
	M 21 <em>a</em> 5. Living is joy, but death can only weep. You see in death
	escape from what you made. But this you do not see; that you made
	death, and it is but illusion of an end. Death cannot be escape,
	because it is not life in which the problem lies. Life has no opposite,
	for it is God. Life and death seem to be opposites because you have
	decided151 death ends life. Forgive the world, and you will
	understand that everything which152 God created cannot have an
	end, and nothing He did not create is real. In this one sentence is
	our course explained. In this one sentence is our practicing given its

	one direction. And in this153 the Holy Spirit’s whole curriculum is
	specified exactly as it is.
	M 21 <em>a</em> 6. What is the peace of God? No more than this; the simple
	understanding that His Will is wholly without opposite. There is no
	thought that contradicts His Will, yet can be true. The contrast
	between His Will and yours but seemed to be reality. In truth there
	is154 no conflict, because His Will is yours. Now is the mighty Will
	of God Himself His gift to you. He does not seek to keep it for
	Himself. Why would you seek to keep your tiny, frail imaginings
	apart from Him? The Will of God is One and all there is. This is
	your heritage. The universe beyond the sun and stars, and all the
	thoughts of which you can conceive, belong to you. God’s peace is
	the condition for His Will. Attain His peace, and you remember
	Him. M(52)
	22. <em>what is the</em> ROLE <em>of</em> WORDS <em>in</em> HEALING?
	M 22 <em>a</em> 1. Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing.
	The
	motivating factor is prayer, or asking. What you ask for you
	receive.155 But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words
	you use in praying. Sometimes the words and the prayer are
	contradictory; sometimes they agree. It does not matter. God does
	not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to
	keep them in the illusion of separation. Words can be helpful,
	particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and
	facilitating the exclusion or at least the control of extraneous
	thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of
	symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality.
	M 22 <em>a</em> 2. As symbols, words have quite specific references. Even
	when they seem most abstract, the picture which156 comes to mind is
	apt to be very concrete. Unless a specific referent does occur to the
	mind in conjunction with the word, the word has little or no
	153 FIP adds the words “one sentence.” Those words are not present in the
	Notes.
	154 FIP changes “is” to “was” which is the reading in the Notes.
	155 Matthew 21:22 “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,
	believing, ye shall receive.”
	156 FIP changes “which” to “that;” the Notes has “which.”

	III‐56
	practical meaning and thus cannot help the healing process. The
	prayer of the heart does not really ask for concrete things. It always
	requests some kind of experience, the specific things asked for being
	the bringers of the desired experience in the judgment157 of the
	asker. The words, then, are symbols for the thing158 asked for, but
	the things themselves but stand for the experiences which159 are
	hoped for.
	M 22 <em>a</em> 3. The prayer for things of this world will bring experiences
	of this world. If the prayer of the heart asks for this, this will be
	given because this will be received. It is impossible that the prayer
	of the heart remain unanswered in the perception of the one who
	asks. If he asks for the impossible, if he wants what does not exist or
	seeks for illusions in his heart, all this becomes his own. The power
	of his decision offers it to him as he requests. Herein lie hell and
	Heaven. The sleeping Son of God has but this power left to him. It
	is enough. His words do not matter. Only the Word of God has any
	meaning, because it symbolizes that which has no human symbols
	at all. The Holy Spirit alone understands what this Word stands for.
	And this, too, is enough. M(53)
	M 22 <em>a</em> 4. Is the teacher of God then to avoid the use of words in his
	teaching? No, indeed. There are many who must be reached
	through words, being as yet unable to hear in silence. The teacher of
	God must, however, learn to use words in a new way. Gradually,
	he learns how to let his words be chosen for him by ceasing to
	decide for himself what he will say. This process is merely a special
	case of the Workbook lesson160 “I will step back and let Him lead the
	way.” The teacher of God accepts the words which are offered him
	and gives as he receives. He does not control the direction of his
	speaking. He listens and hears and speaks.
	157 FIP changes “judgement” to “opinion.” The Notes has “opinion” written
	first, crossed out, and
	changed to “judgement.”
	158 FIP changes “thing” to “things.” The Notes has “things.”
	159 FIP changes “which” to “that.” The Notes has “which.”
	160 FIP changes “Workbook lesson” to “lesson in the workbook that says.” The
	Notes has “lesson in the
	workbook which says…”

	M 22 <em>a</em> 5. A major hindrance in this aspect of his learning is the
	teacher of God’s fear about the validity of what he hears. And what
	he hears may indeed be quite startling. It may also seem to be161
	irrelevant to the presented problem as he perceives it, and may, in
	fact, confront him162 with a situation that appears to be very
	embarrassing.163 All these are judgements which have no value.
	They are his own, coming from the shabby self‐perception that164 he
	would leave behind. Judge not the words that come to you, but
	offer them in confidence. They are far wiser than your own. God’s
	teachers have God’s Word behind their symbols. And He Himself
	gives to the words they use the power of His Spirit, raising them
	from meaningless symbols to the call of Heaven itself.
	23. <em>how</em> ARE HEALING AND <em>atonement</em> RELATED?
	M 23 <em>a</em> 1. Healing and Atonement are not related; they are identical.
	There is no order of difficulty in miracles because there are no
	degrees of Atonement. It is the one complete concept possible in
	this world, because it is the source of a wholly unified perception.
	Partial Atonement is a meaningless idea, just as special areas of hell
	in Heaven is165 inconceivable. Accept Atonement and you are
	healed. Atonement is the Word of God. Accept His Word and what
	remains to make sickness possible? Accept His Word and every
	miracle has been accomplished. To forgive is to heal. The teacher of
	God has taken accepting the Atonement for himself as his only
	function. What is there then he cannot heal? What miracle can be
	withheld from him? M(54)
	M 23 <em>a</em> 2. The progress of the teacher of God may be slow or rapid,
	depending on whether he recognises the Atonement’s inclusiveness
	or for a time excludes some problem areas from it. In some cases,
	161 FIP adds “quite” which is also in the Notes.
	162 FIP changes “him” to “the teacher.” The Notes has “the teacher.”
	163 FIP adds “to him” and so does the Notes.
	164 FIP changes “that” to “which;” the Notes also has “which.”
	165 FIP changes “is” to “are” viewing the subject as the plural “special
	areas.” In fact the subject is the
	implied “[the idea of] special areas.” It’s not the “special areas” which are
	inconceivable, but the <em>idea</em>
	of them. The Notes has it as “is.”
	1715 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐58
	there is a sudden and complete awareness of the perfect
	applicability of the lesson of the166 Atonement to all situations.
	This,167 however, is comparatively rare. The teacher of God may
	have accepted the function God has given him long before he has
	learned all that his acceptance holds out to him. It is only the end
	that is certain. Anywhere along the way,168 the necessary realisation
	of inclusiveness may reach him. If the way seems long, let him be
	content. He has decided on the direction he will169 take. What more
	is170 asked of him? And having done what was required, would
	God withhold the rest?
	M 23 <em>a</em> 3. That forgiveness is healing needs to be understood, if the
	teacher of God is to make progress. The idea that a body can be sick
	is a central concept in the ego’s thought system. This thought gives
	the body autonomy, separates it from the mind, and keeps the idea
	of attack inviolate. If the body could be sick Atonement would be
	impossible. A body that can order a mind to do as it sees fit could171
	merely take the place of God and prove salvation is impossible.
	What then is left to heal? The body has become lord of the mind.
	How could the mind be returned to the Holy Spirit unless the body
	is killed? And who would want salvation at such a price?
	M 23 <em>a</em> 4. Certainly sickness does not appear to be a decision. Nor
	would anyone actually believe he wants to be sick. Perhaps he can
	accept the idea in theory, but it is rarely if ever consistently applied
	to all specific forms of sickness, both in the individual’s perception
	of himself and of all others as well. Nor is it at this level that the
	teacher of God calls forth the miracle of healing. He overlooks the
	166 The word “the” is not present in the Urtext manuscript, but it is present
	in the Notes and in FIP. This
	is being regarded as an inadvertent omission.
	167 FIP replaces the period with a comma and then adds “but” and deletes
	“however.” The Notes is the
	same as FIP “… the Atonement to all situations, but this is comparatively
	rare.”
	168 Illegible handwritten mark-up suggests something, possibly “line” in place
	of “way.” FIP and the
	Notes are all the same here.
	169 FIP changes “will” to “wants to.” The Notes also has “wants to.”
	170 FIP replaces “is” with “was.” The Notes also has “was.”
	171 The Manuscript shows “could” handwritten above “would.” FIP chooses
	“could” which is also the
	reading in the Notes.

	mind and body, seeing only the Face of Christ shining in front of
	him, correcting all mistakes and healing all perception. Healing is
	the result of the recognition, by God’s teacher, of Who it is that is in
	need of healing. This recognition has no special reference. It is true
	of all things that God created. In it are all illusions healed. M(55)
	M 23 <em>a</em> 5. When a teacher of God fails to heal, it is because he has
	forgotten Who he is. Another’s sickness thus becomes his own. In
	allowing this to happen, he has identified with another’s ego, and
	has thus confused him with a body. In so doing, he has refused to
	accept172 Atonement for himself, and can hardly offer it to his
	brother in Christ’s Name. He will, in fact, be unable to recognise his
	brother at all, for his Father did not create bodies, and so he is seeing
	in a173 brother only the unreal. Mistakes do not correct mistakes,
	and distorted perception does not heal. Step back now, teacher of
	God. You have been wrong. Lead not the way, for you have lost it.
	Turn quickly to your Teacher, and let yourself be healed.
	M 23 <em>a</em> 6. The offer of Atonement is universal. It is equally
	applicable to all individuals in all circumstances. And in it is the
	power to heal all individuals of all forms of sickness. Not to believe
	this is to be unfair to God, and thus unfaithful to Him. A sick
	person perceives himself as separate from God. Would you see him
	as separate from you? It is your task to heal the sense of separation
	that has made him sick. It is your function to recognise for him that
	what he believes about himself is not the truth.174 It is your
	forgiveness that must show him this. Healing is very simple.
	Atonement is received and offered. Having been received, it must
	be accepted. It is in the receiving, then, that healing lies. All else
	must follow from this single purpose.
	M 23 <em>a</em> 7. Who can limit the power of God Himself? Who then can
	say who175 can be healed of what, and what must176 remain beyond
	172 FIP inserts “the” before “Atonement.” The Notes has no “the” here.
	173 FIP replaces “a brother” with “his brother.” The Notes has “his brother.”
	174 Handwritten mark-up suggests “true,” FIP keeps “the truth” and that is
	what the Notes has also.
	175 FIP replaces “who” with “which one.” The Notes has “who.”
	1717 PROOF COPY

	III‐60
	God’s power to forgive? This is insanity indeed. It is not up to
	God’s teachers to set limits upon Him, because it is not up to them
	to judge His Son. And to judge His Son is to limit his Father. Both
	are equally meaningless. Yet this will not be understood until God’s
	teacher recognises that they are the same mistake. Herein does he
	receive Atonement, for he withdraws his judgement from the Son of
	God, accepting him as God created him. No longer does he stand
	apart from God, determining where healing should be given and
	where it should be withheld. Now can he say with God, “This is my
	beloved Son,177 created perfect and forever so.” M(56)
	24. DOES JESUS <em>have a</em> <em>special</em> <em>place in</em> HEALING?
	M 24 <em>a</em> 1. God’s gifts can rarely be received directly. Even the most
	advanced of God’s teachers will give way to temptation in this
	world. Would it be fair if their pupils were denied healing because
	of this? The Bible says “Ask in the name of Jesus Christ.”178 Is this
	merely an appeal to magic? A name does not heal, nor does an
	invocation call forth any special power. What does it mean to call
	on Jesus Christ? What does calling on his Name confer? Why is the
	appeal to him part of healing?
	M 24 <em>a</em> 2. We have repeatedly stated179 that one who has perfectly
	accepted the Atonement for himself can heal the world. Indeed, he
	has already done so. Temptation may recur to others, but never to
	this One. He has become the risen Son of God. He has overcome
	death because he has accepted Life. He has recognised himself as
	God created him, and in so doing he has recognised all living things
	as part of him. There is now no limit on his power, because it is the
	Power of God. So has his name become the Name of God, for he no
	longer sees himself as separate from Him.
	176 Handwritten mark-up suggests “must still.” Both FIP and the Notes have it
	as it is here.
	177 Matthew 17:5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
	overshadowed them; and suddenly
	a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am
	well pleased. Hear
	Him!”
	178 John 14:13-14 “And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the
	Father may be glorified
	in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.”
	179 FIP replaces “stated” with “said.” The Notes has “stated.”

	III‐61
	M 24 <em>a</em> 3. What does this mean to you? It means that in
	remembering Jesus you are remembering God. The whole
	relationship of the Son to the Father lies in him. His part in the
	Sonship is also yours, and his completed learning guarantees your
	own success. Is he still available for help? What did he say about
	this? Remember his promises,180 and ask yourself honestly whether
	it is likely that181 he will fail to keep them. Can God fail His Son?
	And can one who is one with God be unlike Him? Who transcends
	the body has transcended limitation. Would the greatest teacher be
	unavailable to those who follow him?
	M 24 <em>a</em> 4. The name of Jesus Christ as such is but a symbol. But it
	stands for love that is not of this world. It is a symbol that can safely
	be used182 as a replacement for the many names of all the gods you
	pray to.183 It becomes the shining symbol for the Word of God, so
	close to What it stands for that the little space between the two is
	lost the moment that the Name is called to mind. Remembering His
	name is to M(57) give thanks for all the gifts that God has given you.
	And gratitude to God becomes the way in which He is remembered,
	for love cannot be far behind a grateful heart and thankful mind.
	God enters easily, for these are the true conditions for your coming
	home.184
	M 24 <em>a</em> 5. Jesus has led the way. Why would you not be grateful to
	him? He has asked for love, but only that he might give it to you.
	You do not love yourself. But in his eyes your loveliness is so
	complete and flawless that he sees in it an image of his Father. You
	become the symbol of his Father here on earth. To you he looks for
	hope, because in you he sees no limit and no stain to mar your
	beautiful perfection. In his eyes Christ’s vision shines in perfect
	180 There are so many specific and general “promises” Jesus made in the Bible,
	to begin to cite them
	would require a separate book! Matthew 28:20 is apt however: “lo, I am with
	you always, even unto
	the end of the world.”

	to.”

	constancy. He has remained with you. Would you not learn the
	lesson of salvation through his learning? Why would you choose to
	start again, when he has made the journey for you?
	M 24 <em>a</em> 6. No‐one on earth can grasp what Heaven is, or what its One
	Creator really means. Yet we have witnesses. It is to them that
	wisdom would185 appeal. There have been those whose learning far
	exceeds what you186 can learn. Nor would we teach the limitations
	we have laid on us. No‐one who has become a true and dedicated
	teacher of God forgets his brothers. Yet what he can offer them is
	limited by what he learns himself. Then turn to one who laid all
	limits by, and went beyond the farthest reach of learning. He will
	take you with him, for he did not go alone. And you were with him
	then, as you are now.
	M 24 <em>a</em> 7. This course has come from him because his words have
	reached you in a language you can love and understand. Are other
	teachers possible, to lead the way to those who speak in different
	tongues and appeal to different symbols? Certainly there are.
	Would God leave anyone without a very present help in time of
	trouble; a Saviour who can symbolize Himself? Yet do we need a
	many‐faceted curriculum, not because of content differences but
	because symbols must shift and change to suit the need. Jesus has
	come to answer yours. In him you find God’s Answer. Do you then
	teach with him,187for he is with you; he is always here. M(58)
	25. <em>is</em> REINCARNATION TRUE?
	M 25 <em>a</em> 1. In the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible. There
	is
	no past nor future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning
	either once or many times. Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in
	any real sense. Our only question should be, “Is the concept
	helpful?” And that depends, of course, on what it is used for. If it is
	185 FIP replaces “would” with “should.” The Notes has “... that wisdom sh
	would appeal.” It appears
	that Schucman began to write “should” then crossed out the “sh” and proceeded
	to write “would.”
	186 FIP changes “you” to “we.” The glyph used in the Notes is that most
	commonly used for “we”
	rather than “you.”
	187 Mathew 28:20 “lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.”
	1720 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐63
	used to strengthen the recognition of the eternal nature of life it is
	helpful indeed. Is any other question about it really useful in
	lighting up the way? Like many other beliefs, it can be bitterly
	misused. At least, such misuse offers preoccupation and perhaps
	pride in the past. At worst, it induces inertia in the present. In
	between, many kinds of folly are possible.
	M 25 <em>a</em> 2. Reincarnation would not, under any circumstances, be the
	problem to be dealt with now. If it were responsible for some of the
	difficulties the individual faces now, his task would still be only to
	escape from them now. If he is laying the groundwork for a future
	life, he can still work out his salvation only now. To some there may
	be comfort in the concept, and if it heartens them its value is selfevident.
	It is certain, however, that the way to salvation can be
	found by those who believe in reincarnation and by those who do
	not. The idea cannot, therefore, be regarded as essential to the
	curriculum. There is always some risk in seeing the present in terms
	of the past. There is always some good in any thought which
	strengthens the idea that life and the body are not the same.
	M 25 <em>a</em> 3. For our purposes, it would not be helpful to take any
	definite stand on reincarnation. A teacher of God should be as
	helpful to those who believe in it as to those who do not. If a
	definite stand on it188 were required of him, it would merely limit his
	usefulness as well as his own decision‐making. Our course is not
	concerned with any concept that is not acceptable to anyone,
	regardless of his formal beliefs. His ego will be enough for him to
	cope with, and it is not the189 part of wisdom to add sectarian
	controversies to his burdens. Nor would there be an advantage in
	his premature acceptance of the course merely because it advocates
	a long‐held belief of his own. M(59)
	188 FIP omits “on it.” The words “on it” are present in the Notes.
	189 The word “the” is not present in the Urtext manuscript; however it is
	present in FIP and in the Notes.
	We include it because its presence is clearly called for and its absence
	appears to be an inadvertent
	omission.
	1721 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐64
	M 25 <em>a</em> 4. It cannot be too strongly <em>emphasised</em> that this
	course aims
	at a complete reversal of thought. When this is finally accomplished
	issues such as the validity of reincarnation become meaningless.
	Until then they are likely to be merely controversial. The teacher of
	God is therefore wise to step away from all such questions, for he
	has much to teach and learn apart from them. He should both learn
	and teach that theoretical issues but waste time, draining it away
	from its appointed purpose. If there are aspects to any concept or
	belief that will be helpful, he will be told about it. He will also be
	told how to use it. What more need he know?
	M 25 <em>a</em> 5. Does this mean that the teacher of God should not believe
	in reincarnation himself, or discuss it with others who do? The
	answer
	is, certainly not. If he does believe in reincarnation, it would be a
	mistake for him to renounce the belief unless his Internal Teacher so
	advised. And this is most unlikely. He might be advised that he is
	misusing the belief in some way which190 is detrimental to his
	pupilʹs advance or his own. Reinterpretation would then be
	recommended because it would be necessary. All that must be
	recognised, however, is191 that birth was not the beginning and
	death is not the end. Yet even this much is not required of the
	beginner. He need merely accept the idea that what he knows is not
	necessarily all there is to learn. His journey has begun.
	M 25 <em>a</em> 6. The emphasis of this course always remains the same; – it
	is at this moment that complete salvation is offered you, and it is at
	this moment that you can accept it. This is still your one
	responsibility. Atonement might be equated with total escape from
	the past and total lack of interest in the future. Heaven is here.
	There is nowhere else. Heaven is now. There is no other time. No
	teaching that does not lead to this is of concern to Godʹs teachers.
	All beliefs will point to this if properly interpreted. In this sense it
	can be said that their truth lies in their usefulness. All beliefs that

	have “is.”

	lead to progress should be honoured. This is the sole criterion this
	course requires. No more than this is necessary. M(60)
	26. ARE “PSYCHIC” POWERS <em>desirable</em> ?
	M 26 <em>a</em> 1. The answer to this question is much like the preceding one.
	There are, of course, no “unnatural” powers, and it is obviously
	merely an appeal to magic to make up a power that does not exist.
	It is equally obvious, however, that each individual has many
	abilities of which he is unaware. As his awareness increases, he may
	well develop abilities that seem quite startling to him. Yet nothing
	that192 he can do can compare even in the slightest with the glorious
	surprise of remembering Who he is. Let all his learning and all his
	effort193 be directed toward this one great final surprise, and he will
	not be content to be delayed by the little ones that may come to him
	on the way.
	M 26 <em>a</em> 2. Certainly there are many “psychic” powers that are clearly
	in line with this course. Communication is not limited to the small
	range of channels the world recognises. If it were there would be
	little point in trying to teach salvation. It would be impossible to do
	so. The limits the world places on communication is194 the chief
	barrier to direct experience of the Holy Spirit, Whose Presence is
	always there and Whose Voice is available but for the hearing.
	These limits are placed out of fear, for without them the walls that
	surround all the separate places of the world would fall at the holy
	sound of His Voice.195 Who transcends these limits in any way is
	merely becoming more natural. He is doing nothing special, and
	there is no magic in his accomplishments.
	192 FIP omits “that” although it is present in the Notes.
	193 FIP changes “effort” to “efforts” but it is “effort” in the Notes.
	194 FIP changes “is” to “are” reading “the limits” as a plural subject. The
	Notes rather clearly has it the
	same as the Urtext manuscript. However, “limits” can be a single body of
	limitations which could be
	construed as a singular subject. This is a “noun clause” which can be
	singular, referring essentially to a
	singular “body of limits” as it were. We’re leaving it singular.
	195 Joshua 6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And
	it happened when the
	people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great
	shout, that the wall fell down
	flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him,
	and they took the city.

	way can be very helpful. Given to the Holy Spirit, and used under
	His direction, they are very196 valuable teaching aids. To this, the
	question of how they arise is irrelevant. The only important
	consideration is how they are used. Taken197 as ends in themselves,
	no matter how this is done, will delay progress. Nor does their
	value lie in proving anything; achievements from the past, unusual
	attunement with the “unseen,” or special favors from God. God
	gives no special favors, and no‐one has any powers that are not
	available to everyone. Only by tricks of magic are special powers
	“demonstrated.” M(61)
	M 26 <em>a</em> 4. Nothing that is genuine is used to deceive. The Holy Spirit
	is incapable of deception, and He can use only genuine abilities.
	What is used for magic is useless to Him, but what He uses cannot
	be used for magic. There is, however, a particular appeal in unusual
	abilities which198 can be curiously tempting. Here are strengths
	which the Holy Spirit wants and needs. Yet the ego sees in these
	same strengths an opportunity to glorify itself. Strengths turned to
	weakness are tragedy indeed. Yet what is not given to the Holy
	Spirit must be given to weakness, for what is withheld from love is
	given to fear, and will be fearful in consequence.199
	M 26 <em>a</em> 5. Even those who no longer value the material things of the
	world may still be deceived by “psychic” powers. As investment
	has been withdrawn from the world’s material gifts the ego has
	been seriously threatened. It may still be strong enough to rally
	under this new temptation to win back strength by guile. Many
	have not seen through the ego’s defences here, although they are not
	particularly subtle. Yet, given a remaining wish to be deceived,
	deception is made easy. Now the “power” is no longer a genuine
	ability, and cannot be used dependably. It is almost inevitable that,
	196 FIP omits “very” although it is present in the Notes.
	197 FIP replaces “Taken” with “Taking them.” The Notes has “Taken.”
	198 FIP replaces “which” with “that” but the Notes has “which.”

	unless the individual changes his mind about its purpose, he will
	bolster200 its uncertainties with increasing deception.
	M 26 <em>a</em> 6. Any ability that anyone develops has the potentiality for
	good. To this there is no exception. And the more unusual and
	unexpected the power, the greater its201 potential usefulness.
	Salvation has need of all abilities, for what the world would destroy
	the Holy Spirit would restore. “Psychic” abilities have been used to
	call upon the devil, which merely means to strengthen the ego. Yet
	here is also a great channel of hope and healing in the Holy Spirit’s
	service. Those who have developed “psychic” powers have
	merely202 let some of the limitations they laid upon their minds be
	lifted. It can be but greater203 limitations they lay upon themselves if
	they utilise their increased freedom for further204 imprisonment.
	The Holy Spirit needs these gifts, and those who offer them to Him
	and Him alone go with Christ’s gratitude upon their hearts, and His
	holy sight not far behind. M(62)
	27. CAN <em>God</em> BE REACHED <em>directly</em>?
	M 27 <em>a</em> 1. God indeed can be reached directly, for there is no
	distance
	between Him and His Son. His awareness is in everyone’s memory
	and His Word is written on everyone’s heart.205 Yet this awareness
	and this memory can arise across the threshold of the unconscious206
	only where all barriers to truth have been removed. In how many is
	this the case? Here then is the role of God’s teachers. They too have
	not attained the necessary understanding as yet, but they have
	joined with others. This is what sets them apart from the world.
	200 FIP adds “his “power’s”” but that is not present in the Notes.
	201 Urtext manuscript has “is,” but it should obviously be “its.” FIP agrees.
	The Notes has “its.”
	202 FIP replaces “merely” with “simply.” The Notes has “merely.”
	203 FIP replaces “greater limitations” with “further limitations.” The Notes
	has “grater burdens.”
	204 FIP replaces “further” with “greater.” The Notes has “further.”
	205 Jeremiah 31:33 “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house
	of Israel after those days,”
	saith the LORD; “I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart
	will I write it; and I will be
	their God, and they shall be my people:”
	Romans 2:15 Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their
	conscience also bearing
	witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them.
	206 FIP replaces “the unconscious” with “recognition.” The Notes has
	“unconscious.”

	III‐68
	And it is this that enables others to leave the world with them.
	Alone they are nothing. But in their joining is the Power of God.
	M 27 <em>a</em> 2. There are those who have reached God directly, retaining
	no trace of worldly limits and remembering their own Identity
	perfectly. These might be called the Teachers of teachers because,
	although they are no longer visible, their image can yet be called
	upon. And they will appear when and where it is helpful for them
	to do so. To those to whom such appearances would be frightening,
	they give their ideas. No‐one can call on them in vain. Nor is there
	anyone of whom they are unaware. All needs are known to them,
	and all mistakes are recognised and overlooked by them. The time
	will come when this is understood. And meanwhile, they give all
	their gifts to the teachers of God who look to them for help, asking
	all things in Their Name and in no other.
	M 27 <em>a</em> 3. Sometimes a teacher of God may have a brief experience of
	direct union with God. In this world, it is almost impossible that
	this endure. It can, perhaps, be won after much devotion and
	dedication, and then be maintained for most207 of the time on earth.
	But this is so rare that it cannot be considered a realistic goal. If it
	happens, so be it. If it does not happen, so be it as well. All worldly
	states must be illusory. If God were reached directly in sustained
	awareness, the body would not be long maintained. Those who
	have laid the body down merely to extend their helpfulness to those
	remaining behind are few indeed. And they need helpers who are
	still in bondage and still asleep, so that by their awakening can
	God’s Voice be heard. M(63)
	M 27 <em>a</em> 4. Do not despair, then, because of limitations. It is your
	function to escape from them, but not to be without them. If you
	would be heard by those who suffer, you must speak their
	language. If you would be Saviours, you must understand what
	needs to be escaped. Salvation is not theoretical. Behold the
	problem, ask for the answer, and then accept the answer208 when it
	207 Handwritten mark-up suggests and FIP replaces “most” with “much.” The
	Notes has “most.”
	208 FIP replaces “the answer” with “it.” The Notes has “the answer.”

	comes. Nor will its coming be long delayed. All the help you can
	accept will be provided, and not one need you have will not be met.
	Let us not, then, be too concerned with goals for which you are not
	ready. God takes you where you are and welcomes you. What
	more could you desire, when this is all you need?
	28. <em>what is</em> DEATH?
	M 28 <em>a</em> 1. Death is the central dream from which all illusions stem.
	Is
	it not madness to think of life as being born, aging, losing vitality,
	and dying in the end? We have asked this question before, but now
	we need to consider it still209 more carefully. It is the one fixed,
	unchangeable belief of the world that all things in it are born only to
	die. This is regarded as “the way of nature,” not to be raised to
	question, but to be accepted as the “natural” law of life. The
	cyclical, the changing and unsure; the undependable and the
	unsteady, waxing and waning in a certain way upon a certain path,
	– all this is taken as the Will of God. And no‐one asks if a benign
	Creator could will this.
	M 28 <em>a</em> 2. In this perception of the universe as God created it, it
	would not be possible210 to think of Him as loving. For who decreed
	that all things pass away, ending in dust and disappointment and
	despair, can211 but be feared. He holds your little life in his hand but
	by a thread, ready to break it off without regret or care, perhaps
	today. Or if he waits, yet is the ending certain. Who loves such a
	god knows not of love, because he has denied that life is real. Death
	has become life’s symbol. His world is now a battleground, where
	contradiction reigns and opposites make endless war. Where there
	is death is peace impossible. M(64)
	M 28 <em>a</em> 3. Death is the symbol of the fear of God. His Love is blotted
	out in the idea, which holds It from awareness like a shield held212 to
	209 FIP omits “still” however it is present in the Notes.
	210 FIP replaces “would not be possible” with “would be impossible.” The Notes
	has “would not be
	possible.”
	211 Handwritten mark-up suggests “could” in place of “can.” The Notes has
	“can.”
	212 FIP changes “shield held” to “shield held up.” The Notes has “shield
	held.”
	1727 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐70
	obscure the sun. The grimness of the symbol is enough to show it
	cannot co‐exist with God. It holds an image of the Son of God in
	which he is “laid to rest” in devastation’s arms, where worms
	await213 to greet him and to last a little while by his destruction. Yet
	the worms as well are doomed to be destroyed as certainly. And so
	do all things live because of death. Devouring is nature’s “law of
	life.” God is insane, and fear alone is real.
	M 28 <em>a</em> 4. The curious belief that there is part of dying things that
	may go on apart from what will die does not proclaim a loving God,
	nor re‐establish any grounds for trust. If death is real for anything
	there is no life. Death denies life. But if there is reality in life, death
	is denied. No compromise in this is possible. There is either a god
	of fear or One of Love. The world attempts a thousand
	compromises, and will attempt a thousand more. Not one can be
	acceptable to God’s teachers, because not one could be acceptable to
	God. He did not make death because He did not make fear. Both
	are equally meaningless to Him.
	M 28 <em>a</em> 5. The “reality” of death is firmly rooted in the belief that
	God’s Son is a body. And if God created bodies, death would
	indeed be real. But God would not be loving. There is no point at
	which the contrast between the perception of the real world and that
	of the world of illusions becomes more sharply evident. Death is
	indeed the death of God, if He is Love. And now His Own creation
	must stand in fear of Him. He is not Father but destroyer. He is not
	Creator but avenger. Terrible His Thoughts and fearful His image.
	To look on His creations is to die. M(65)
	M 28 <em>a</em> 6. “And the last to be overcome will be death.”214 Of course!
	Without the idea of death there is no world. All dreams will end
	with this one. This is salvation’s final goal; the end of all illusions.
	And in death are all illusions born. What can be born of death and
	still have life? But what is born of God and still can die? The
	inconsistencies, the compromises and the rituals the world fosters in
	213 FIP changes “await” to “wait.” The Notes has “await.”

	(ASV)
	1728 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐71
	its vain attempts to cling to death and yet to think love real are
	mindless magic, ineffectual and meaningless. God is, and in Him all
	created things must be eternal. Do you not see that otherwise He
	has an opposite, and fear would be as real as love?
	M 28 <em>a</em> 7. Teacher of God, your one assignment could be stated thus:
	Accept no compromise in which death plays a part. Do not believe
	in cruelty, nor let attack conceal the truth from you. What seems to
	die has215 been misperceived and carried216 to illusion. Now it
	becomes your task to let the illusion be carried217 to the truth. Be
	steadfast but in this; be not deceived by the “reality” of any
	changing form. Truth neither moves nor wavers nor sinks down to
	death and dissolution. And what is the end of death? Nothing but
	this; the realisation that the Son of God is guiltless now and forever.
	Nothing but this. But do not let yourself forget it is not less than
	this. M(66)
	29. <em>what is the</em> RESURRECTION?
	M 29 <em>a</em> 1. Very simply, the resurrection is the overcoming or
	surmounting of death. It is a reawakening or a rebirth; a change of
	mind about the meaning of the world. It is the acceptance of the
	Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the world’s purpose; the acceptance of
	the Atonement for oneself. It is the end of dreams of misery and the
	glad awareness of the Holy Spirit’s final dream. It is the recognition
	of the gifts of God. It is the dream in which the body functions
	perfectly, having no function except communication. It is the lesson
	in which learning ends, for it is consummated and surpassed with
	this. It is the invitation to God to take His final step. It is the
	relinquishment of all other purposes, all other interests, all other
	wishes and all other concerns. It is the single desire of the Son for
	the Father.
	215 Handwritten mark-up and FIP insert “but” here. The word “but” is not
	present in the Notes.
	216 Handwritten mark-up offers “brought” as a substitute for “carried.” The
	Notes has “carried” and so
	does FIP.
	217 ibid
	1729 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐72
	M 29 <em>a</em> 2. The resurrection is the denial of death, being the
	assertion
	of life. Thus is all the thinking of the world reversed entirely. Life is
	now recognised as salvation, and pain and misery of any kind
	perceived as hell. Love is no longer feared but gladly welcomed.
	Idols have disappeared, and the remembrance of God shines
	unimpeded across the world. Christ’s face is seen in every living
	thing, and nothing is held in darkness apart from the light of
	forgiveness. There is no sorrow still upon the earth. The joy of
	Heaven has come upon it.
	M 29 <em>a</em> 3. Here the curriculum ends. From here on no directions are
	needed. Vision is wholly corrected and all mistakes undone. Attack
	is meaningless and peace has come. The goal of the curriculum has
	been achieved. Thoughts turn to Heaven and away from hell. All
	longings are satisfied, for what remains unanswered or incomplete?
	The last illusion spreads over218 the world, forgiving all things and
	replacing all attack. The whole reversal is accomplished. Nothing is
	left to contradict the Word of God. There is no opposition to the
	truth. And now the truth can come at last. How quickly will it
	come as it is asked to enter and envelop such a world! M(67)
	M 29 <em>a</em> 4. All living hearts are tranquil, with a stir of deep
	anticipation, for the time of everlasting things is now at hand. There
	is no death. The Son of God is free. And in His freedom is the end
	of fear. No hidden places now remain on earth to shelter sick
	illusions, dreams of fear and misperceptions of the universe. All
	things are seen in light, and in the light their purpose is transformed
	and understood. And we, God’s children, rise up from the dust and
	look upon our perfect sinlessness. The song of Heaven sounds
	around the world, as it is lifted up and brought to truth.
	M 29 <em>a</em> 5. Now there are no distinctions. Differences have
	disappeared and Love looks on Itself. What further sight is needed?
	What remains that vision could accomplish? We have seen the face
	of Christ, His sinlessness, His Love behind all forms, beyond all
	218 FIP replaces “over” with “across.” The Notes has “over.”

	III‐73
	purposes. Holy are we because His Holiness has set us free indeed!
	And we accept His Holiness as ours; as it is. As God created us so
	will we be forever and forever, and we wish for nothing but His
	Will to be our own. Illusions of another will are219 lost, for unity of
	purpose has been found.
	M 29 <em>a</em> 6. These things await us all, but we are not prepared as yet
	to
	welcome them with joy. As long as any mind remains possessed of
	evil dreams the thought of hell is real. God’s teachers have the goal
	of wakening the minds of those asleep, and seeing there the vision
	of Christ’s face to take the place of what they dream.220 The thought
	of murder is replaced with blessing. Judgement is laid by, and given
	Him Whose function judgement is. And in His final judgement is
	restored the truth about the holy Son of God. He is redeemed, for
	he has heard God’s Word and understood Its meaning. He is free
	because he let God’s Voice proclaim the truth. And all he sought
	before to crucify are resurrected with him, by his side as he prepares
	with them to meet his God. M(68)
	30. <em>as</em> FOR <em>the</em> REST
	M 30 <em>a</em> 1. This manual is not intended to answer all questions which
	both teacher and pupil may raise. In fact, it covers only a few of the
	more obvious ones, in terms of a brief summary of some of the
	major concepts in the text and workbook. It is not a substitute for
	either, but merely a supplement. While it is called a manual for
	teachers, it must be remembered that only time divides teacher and
	pupil, so that the difference is temporary by definition. In some
	cases, it may be helpful for the pupil to read the manual first.
	Others might do better to begin with the workbook. Still others may
	need to start at the more abstract level of the text.
	219 Urtext manuscript has “is,” FIP corrects the agreement in number problem
	as we have with “are.”
	Notes clearly has “is” also. It is possible that “Illusions of another will”
	should be considered a “noun
	clause” which could be construed as singular. We can for instance think of
	this one thing called “our
	illusions of another will” which is capable of being lost. However it seems
	more likely that this is just
	an error and “are” is what was intended.
	220 Urtext manuscript has “dreamed” but handwritten mark-up and FIP replace
	that with “dream.”
	Given that the rest of the paragraph is in the present tense, this seems to be
	an appropriate correction.
	The Notes also has “dream.”
	1731 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐74
	M 30 <em>a</em> 2. Which is for whom?221 Who would profit more from
	prayers alone? Who needs but a smile, being as yet unready for
	more? No‐one should attempt to answer these questions alone.
	Surely no teacher of God has come this far without realising that.
	The curriculum is highly individualized. And all aspects are under
	the Holy Spirit’s particular care and guidance. Ask and He will
	answer. The responsibility is His, and He alone is fit to assume it.
	To do so is His function. To refer the questions to Him is yours.
	Would you want to be responsible for decisions about which you
	understand so little? Be glad you have a Teacher Who cannot make
	a mistake. His answers are always right. Would you say that of
	yours?
	M 30 <em>a</em> 3. There is another advantage,– and a very important one, –
	in referring decisions to the Holy Spirit with increasing frequency.
	Perhaps you have not thought of this aspect, but its centrality is
	obvious. To follow the Holy Spirit’s guidance is to let yourself be
	absolved of guilt. It is the essence of the Atonement. It is the core of
	the curriculum. The imagined usurping of functions not your own
	is the basis of fear. The whole world you see reflects the illusion
	you have done so, making fear inevitable. To return the function to
	the One To Whom it belongs is thus the escape from fear. And it is
	this that lets the memory of love return to M(69) you. Do not, then,
	think that following the Holy Spirit’s guidance is necessary merely
	because of your own inadequacies. It is the way out of hell for you.
	M 30 <em>a</em> 4. Here again is the paradox often referred to in the course.
	To say, “Of myself I can do nothing”222 is to gain all power. And yet
	it is but a seeming paradox. As God created you, you have all
	power. The image you made of yourself has none. The Holy Spirit
	knows the truth about you. The image you made does not. Yet,
	despite its obvious and complete ignorance, this image assumes it
	knows all things because you have given that belief to it. Such is
	221 FIP replaces “whom” with “which.” The Notes has “which” also.
	222 John 5:19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to
	you, the Son can do
	nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the
	Son also does in like
	manner.”
	1732 PROOF COPY
	Volume III Manual for Teachers
	III‐75
	your teaching and the teaching of the world which was made to
	uphold it. But the Teacher Who knows the truth has not forgotten
	it. His decisions bring benefit to all, being wholly devoid of attack.
	And therefore incapable of arousing guilt.
	M 30 <em>a</em> 5. Who assumes a power that he does not have223 is deceiving
	himself. Yet to accept the power given him by God is but to
	acknowledge his Creator and accept His gifts. And His gifts have
	no limit. To ask the Holy Spirit to decide for you is merely224 to
	accept your true inheritance. Does this mean that you cannot say
	anything without consulting Him? No, indeed! That would hardly
	be practical, and it is the practical with which this course is most
	concerned. If you have made it a habit to ask for help when and
	where you can, you can be confident that wisdom will be given you
	when you need it. Prepare for this each morning, remember God
	when you can throughout the day, ask the Holy Spirit’s help when it
	is feasible to do so, and thank Him for His guidance at night. And
	your confidence will be well founded indeed. M(70)
	M 30 <em>a</em> 6. Never forget that the Holy Spirit does not depend on your
	words. He understands the requests of your heart and answers
	them. Does this mean that, while attack remains attractive to you
	He will respond with evil? Hardly! For God has given Him the
	power to translate your prayers of the heart into His language.225
	He understands that an attack is a call for help. And He responds
	with help accordingly. God would be cruel if He let your words
	replace His Own. A loving father does not let his child harm
	himself or choose his own destruction. He may ask for injury, but
	his father will protect him still. And how much more than this does
	your Father love His Son?
	223 FIP replaces “have” with “possess.” In the Notes we find the glyph for
	“have.”
	224 FIP replaces “merely” with “simply.” The Notes has “merely.”
	225 Romans 8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do
	not know what we should
	pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with
	groanings which cannot be
	uttered.

	M 30 <em>a</em> 7. Remember you are His completion and His Love.
	Remember your weakness is His strength.226 But do227 not read this
	hastily or wrongly. If His strength is in you, what you perceive as
	your weakness is but illusion. And He has given you the means to
	prove it so. Ask all things of His Teacher, and all things are given
	you. Not in the future but immediately; now. God does not wait,
	for waiting implies time and He is timeless. Forget your foolish
	images, your sense of frailty and your fear of harm, your dreams of
	danger and selected “wrongs.” God knows but His Son, and as he
	was created so he is. In confidence I place you in His Hands, and I
	give thanks for you that this is so.
	M 30 <em>a</em> 8. And now in all your doings be you blessed.
	God turns to you for help to save the world.
	Teacher of God, His thanks He offers you,
	And all the world stands silent in the grace
	You bring from Him. You are the Son He loves,
	And it is given you to be the means
	Through which His Voice is heard around the world
	To close all things of time, to end the sight
	Of all things visible; and to undo
	All things that change. Through you is ushered in
	<em>a</em> world unseen, unheard, yet truly there.
	Holy are you, and in your light the world M(71)
	Reflects your holiness, for you are not
	Alone and friendless. I give thanks for you,
	And join your efforts on behalf of God,
	Knowing they are on my behalf as well
	And for all those who walk to God with me.
	FINIS228
	226 2 Corinthians 12:9 And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for
	My strength is made
	perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my
	infirmities, that the power of
	Christ may rest upon me.
	227 The word “do” is not present in the Urtext manuscript, nor is it
	handwritten in. FIP includes it and it
	appears to be a necessary correction. It is clearly present in the Notes.
	228 FIP replaces “FINIS” with “AMEN” however neither word appears in the Notes
	which simply ends
	with no comment.

	1. INTRODUCTION
	U 1 <em>a</em> 1. This is not a course in theoretical philosophy, nor is it
	concerned with precise terminology in connection with origins. It is
	concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception.
	The means of the Atonement is forgiveness. The structure of
	ʺindividual consciousnessʺ is essentially irrelevant, because it is a
	concept representing the ʺoriginal errorʺ or the ʺoriginal sin.ʺ To
	study the error itself does not lead to correction, if you are indeed to
	succeed in overlooking the error. And it is just this process of
	overlooking at which the course aims.
	U 1 <em>a</em> 2. All terms are potentially controversial, and those who seek
	controversy will find it. Yet those who seek clarification will find it
	as well. They must, however, be willing to overlook controversy,
	recognising that it is a defence against truth in the form of a
	delaying maneuver. Theological considerations as such are
	necessarily controversial, since they depend on belief and can
	therefore be accepted or rejected. A universal theology is
	impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but
	necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed.
	Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone
	uncertainty ends.
	U 1 <em>a</em> 3. This course remains within the ego framework, where it is
	needed. It is not concerned with what is beyond all error because it
	is planned only to set the direction toward it. Therefore it uses
	words, which are symbolic, and cannot express what lies beyond
	symbols. It is always the ego that questions because it is only the
	ego that doubts. The course merely gives another Answer, once a
	question has been raised. However, this Answer does not attempt
	to resort to inventiveness or ingenuity. These are attributes of the
	ego. <em>the</em> COURSE <em>is</em> SIMPLE. It has one function and one goal.
	Only in that does it remain wholly consistent because only that can
	BE consistent.
	PROOF COPY 1739
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐2
	U 1 <em>a</em> 4. The ego will demand many answers this course does not
	give. It does not recognise as questions the mere form of a question
	to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, ʺHow did the
	impossible occur?ʺ, ʺTo what did the impossible happen?ʺ, and may
	ask1 in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience.
	Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you. (2)
	U 1 <em>a</em> 5. You will notice that the emphasis on structural issues in
	the course is brief and early. Afterwards and soon, it drops away to
	make way for the central teaching. Since you have asked for
	clarification, however, these are some of the terms that are used.2
	2. <em>mind</em>‐SPIRIT
	U 2 <em>a</em> 1. The term “mind” is used to represent the activating agent
	of Spirit, supplying its creative energy. When the term is capitalized
	it refers to God or Christ (i.e., the Mind of God or the Mind of
	Christ). Spirit is the Thought of God which He created like Himself.
	The unified Spirit is Godʹs one Son, or Christ.
	U 2 <em>a</em> 2. In this world, because the mind is split, the Sons of God
	appear to be separate. Nor do their minds seem to be joined. In this
	illusory state, the concept of an ʺindividual mindʺ seems to be
	meaningful. It is therefore described in the course <em>as if</em> it has two
	parts; spirit and ego.
	U 2 <em>a</em> 3. Spirit is the part that is still in contact with God through
	the Holy Spirit, Who abides in this part but sees the other part as
	well. The term ʺsoulʺ is not used except in direct Biblical quotations
	because of its highly controversial nature. It would, however, be an
	equivalent of ʺspirit,ʺ with the understanding that, being of God, it
	is eternal and was never born.
	U 2 <em>a</em> 4. The other part of the mind is entirely illusory and makes
	only illusions. Spirit retains the potential for creating, but its Will
	which is Godʹs, seems to be imprisoned while the mind is not
	1 Handwritten markup inserts “this.”
	2 Originally a colon appears here in the Urtext manuscript. In the Notes there
	is no colon and the
	sentence is “Since you have asked for clarification, however, these are some
	of the terms that are used
	in the beginning.”
	PROOF COPY 1740
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐3
	unified. Creation continues unabated because that is the Will of
	God. This Will is always unified, and therefore has no meaning in
	this world. It has no opposite and no degrees.
	U 2 <em>a</em> 5. The mind can be right or wrong, depending on the voice to
	which it listens. RIGHT‐MINDEDNESS listens to the Holy Spirit,
	forgives the world, and through Christʹs vision sees the real world
	in its place. This is the final vision, the last perception, the condition
	in which God takes the final step Himself. Here time and illusions
	end together.3 <em>wrong</em>‐MINDEDNESS listens to the ego and
	makes illusions; perceiving sin and justifying anger, and seeing
	guilt, disease and death as real. Both this world and the real world
	are illusions because right‐mindedness merely overlooks, or
	forgives, what never happened. U(3) Therefore it is not the ONEMINDEDNESS
	of the Christ Mind, Whose Will is One with Godʹs.
	U 2 <em>a</em> 6. In this world the only remaining freedom is the freedom of
	choice; this choice is always between two choices or two voices.
	Will is not involved in perception at any level, and has nothing to do
	with choice. <em>consciousness</em> is the receptive mechanism,
	receiving messages from above or below; from the Holy Spirit or the
	ego. Consciousness has levels and awareness can shift quite
	dramatically, but it cannot transcend the perceptual realm. At its
	highest it becomes aware of the real world, and can be trained to do
	so increasingly. Yet the very fact that it has levels and can be
	trained demonstrates that consciousness cannot reach knowledge.
	U(4)
	3. <em>the ego</em>‐ <em>the</em> MIRACLE
	U 3 <em>a</em> 1. Illusions will not last. Their death is sure and this alone
	is
	certain in their world. It is the egoʹs world because of this. What is
	the ego? But a dream of what you really are. A thought you are
	apart from your Creator and a wish to be what He created not. It is
	a thing of madness, not reality at all. A name for namelessness is all
	it is. A symbol of impossibility; a choice for options that do not
	3 Handwritten mark-up suggests paragraph break here.
	PROOF COPY 1741
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐4
	exist. We call it that to help us understand that it is nothing but an
	ancient thought that what is made has immortality. But what could
	come of this except a dream which, like all dreams, could only die?
	U 3 <em>a</em> 2. What is the ego? Nothingness, but in a form that seems like
	something. In a world of form the ego cannot be denied for it alone
	seems real. How could Godʹs Son as He created him abide in form
	or in a world of form? Who asks you to define the ego and explain
	how it arose can be but he who thinks it real, and seeks by definition
	to ensure that its illusive nature is concealed behind the words that
	seem to make it so.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 3. There is no definition for a lie that serves to make it
	true.
	Nor can there be a truth that lies conceal effectively. The egoʹs
	unreality is not denied by words nor is its meaning clear because its
	nature seems to have a form. Who can define the undefinable? And
	yet there is an answer even here.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 4. We cannot really make a definition for what the ego is, but
	we CAN say what it is not. And this is shown to us with perfect
	clarity. It is from this that we deduce all that the ego is. Look at its
	opposite and you can see the only answer that is meaningful.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 5. The egoʹs opposite in every way,‐‐in origin, effect and
	consequence‐‐we call a miracle. And here we find all that is not the
	ego in the world. Here is the egoʹs opposite and here alone we look
	on what the ego was. For here we see all that it seemed to do, and
	cause and its effects must still be one.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 6. Where there was darkness now we see the light. What was
	the ego? What the darkness was. Where was the ego? Where the
	darkness was. What is it now and where can it be found? Nothing
	and nowhere. Now the light has come: Its opposite has gone
	without a trace. Where evil was there U(5) now is holiness. What is
	the ego? What the evil was. Where is the ego? In an evil dream that
	but seemed real while you were dreaming it. Where there was
	crucifixion stands Godʹs Son. What is the ego? Who has need to
	ask? Where is the ego? Who has need to seek for an illusion now
	that dreams are gone?
	PROOF COPY 1742
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐5
	U 3 <em>a</em> 7. What is a MIRACLE? A dream as well. But look at all the
	aspects of THIS dream, and you will never question any more.
	Look at the kindly world you see stretched forth before you as you
	walk in gentleness. Look at the helpers all along the way you travel,
	happy in the hope of Heaven and the certainty of peace. And look
	an instant, too, on what you left behind at last and finally passed by.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 8. This was the ego ‐‐ all the cruel hate, the need for
	vengeance and the cries of pain, the fear of dying and the urge to
	kill, the brotherless illusion and the self that seemed alone in all the
	universe. This terrible mistake about yourself the miracle corrects as
	gently as a loving mother sings her child to rest. Is not a song like
	this what you would hear? Would it not answer all you thought to
	ask, and even make the question meaningless?
	U 3 <em>a</em> 9. Your questions have no answer, being made to still Godʹs
	Voice, which asks of everyone one question only:
	ʺAre you ready yet to help Me save the world?ʺ
	Ask this instead of what the ego is, and you will see a sudden
	brightness cover up the world the ego made. No miracle is now
	withheld from anyone. The world is saved from what you thought
	it was. And what it is, is wholly uncondemned and wholly pure.
	U 3 <em>a</em> 10. The miracle forgives; the ego damns. Neither need be
	defined except by this. Yet could a definition be more sure, or more
	in line with what salvation asks? Problem and answer lie together
	here, and having met at last the choice is clear. Who chooses hell
	when it is recognised? And who would not go on a little while when
	it is given him to understand the way is short and Heaven is his
	goal? U(6)
	4. FORGIVENESS – <em>the</em> FACE <em>of</em> CHRIST
	U 4 <em>a</em> 1. Forgiveness is for God and toward God but not of Him. It
	is impossible to think of anything He created that could need
	forgiveness. Forgiveness, then, is an illusion, but because of its
	purpose, which is the Holy Spiritʹs, it has one difference. Unlike all
	other illusions it leads away from error and not toward it.
	PROOF COPY 1743
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐6
	U 4 <em>a</em> 2. Forgiveness might be called a kind of happy fiction; a way
	in which the unknowing can bridge the gap between their
	perception and the truth. They cannot go directly from perception
	to knowledge because they do not think it is their will to do so. This
	makes God appear to be an enemy instead of what He really is.
	And it is just this insane perception that makes them unwilling
	merely to rise up and to return to Him in peace.
	U 4 <em>a</em> 3. And so they need an illusion of Help because they are
	helpless; a Thought of peace because they are in conflict. God
	knows what His Son needs before he asks.4 He is not at all
	concerned with form, but having given the content it is His Will that
	it be understood. And that suffices. The form adapts itself to need;
	the content is unchanging, as eternal as its Creator.
	U 4 <em>a</em> 4. <em>the</em> FACE <em>of</em> CHRIST has to be seen before
	the memory
	of God can return. The reason is obvious. Seeing the Face of Christ
	is perception. No‐one can look on knowledge. But the Face of
	Christ is5 the great symbol of forgiveness. It is salvation. It is the
	symbol of the real world. Whoever looks on this no longer sees the
	world. He is as near to Heaven as is possible outside the gate.6 Yet
	from this gate it is no more than just a step inside. It is the final step.
	And this we leave to God.
	U 4 <em>a</em> 5. It7 is a symbol, too, but as the symbol of His Will alone it
	cannot be divided. And so the Unity that it reflects becomes His
	Will. It is the only thing still in the world in part, and yet the bridge
	to Heaven. U(7)
	U 4 <em>a</em> 6. Godʹs Will is all there is. We can but go from nothingness
	to everything; from hell to Heaven. Is this a journey? No, not in
	truth, for truth goes nowhere. But illusions shift from place to place;
	4 Matthew 6:8 “Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things
	you have need of
	before you ask Him.”
	5 Handwritten mark-up suggests “involves” which FIP adopts. The Notes does not
	include the word
	“involves.”
	6 Genesis 28:17 “And he was afraid and said, ‘How awesome is this place! This
	is none other than the
	house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!’”
	7 Handwritten mark-up suggests “forgiveness” which FIP adopts. The Notes has
	it as it is here, but has
	no paragraph break.
	PROOF COPY 1744
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐7
	from time to time. The final step is also but a shift. As a perception
	it is partly unreal. And yet this part will vanish. What remains is
	peace eternal and the Will of God.
	U 4 <em>a</em> 7. There are no wishes now for wishes change. Even the
	wished‐for can become unwelcome. That must be so because the
	ego cannot be at peace. But Will is constant, as the gift of God. And
	what He gives is always like Himself. This is the purpose of the
	Face of Christ. It is the gift of God to save His Son. But look on this
	and you have been forgiven.
	U 4 <em>a</em> 8. How lovely does the world become in just that single
	instant when you see the truth about yourself reflected there. Now
	you are sinless and behold your sinlessness. Now you are holy and
	perceive it so. And now the mind returns to its Creator; the joining
	of the Father and the Son, the Unity of unities that stands behind all
	joining but still beyond them all. God <em>is not seen but</em> ONLY
	UNDERSTOOD. His Son is not attacked but recognised.
	5. <em>perception</em> ‐ KNOWLEDGE
	U 5 <em>a</em> 1. The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not
	create it, for what He creates must be eternal as Himself. Yet there is
	nothing in the world you see that will endure forever. Some things
	will last in time a little while longer than others. But the time will
	come when all things visible will have an end.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 2. The bodyʹs eyes are therefore not the means by which the
	real world can be seen, for the illusions that they look upon must
	lead to more illusions of reality.8 And so they do. For everything
	they see not only will not last, but lends itself to thoughts of sin and
	guilt. While everything that God created is forever without sin and
	therefore is forever without guilt.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 3. Knowledge is not the remedy for false perception since,
	being another level, they can never meet. The one correction
	possible for false perception must be true perception. U(8) It will
	8 Urtext Manuscript has, in brackets “of reality” here. FIP omits the brackets
	as does the Notes.
	PROOF COPY 1745
	Volume IV Use of Terms
	IV‐8
	not endure. But for the time it lasts it comes to heal. For true
	perception is a remedy with many names. Forgiveness, salvation,
	Atonement, true perception, all are one. They are the9 one
	beginning with the end to lead to Oneness far beyond themselves.
	True perception is the means by which the world is saved from sin,
	for sin does not exist. And it is this that true perception sees.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 4. The world stands like a block before Christʹs face. But true
	perception looks on it as nothing more than just a fragile veil, so
	easily dispelled that it can last no longer than an instant. It is seen at
	last for only what it is. And now it cannot fail to disappear, for now
	there is an empty place made clean and ready. Where destruction
	was perceived the face of Christ appears, and in that instant is the
	world forgot, with time forever ended as the world spins into
	nothingness from where it came.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 5. A world forgiven cannot last. It was the home of bodies.
	But forgiveness looks past bodies. This is its holiness; this is how it
	heals. The world of bodies is the world of sin, for only if there is a
	body is sin possible. From sin comes guilt as surely as forgiveness
	takes all guilt away. And once all guilt is gone what more remains
	to keep a separated world in place? For place has gone as well,
	along with time. Only the body makes the world seem real, for
	being separate it could not remain where separation is impossible.
	Forgiveness proves it is impossible because it sees it not. And what
	you then will overlook will not be understandable to you, just as
	its10 presence once had been your certainty.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 6. This is the shift that true perception brings: What was
	projected out is seen within, and there forgiveness lets it disappear.
	For there the altar to the Son is set, and there his Father is
	remembered. Here are all illusions brought to truth and laid upon
	the altar. What is seen outside must lie beyond forgiveness, for it
	9 The Urtext manuscript has “a” crossed out and “the” handwritten in. The
	Notes has “a.”
	10 The Urtext Manuscript has “just as its opposite was once your certainty”
	which, since “its” refers to
	“sin” appears to be an error. Immediately after this is typed “presence once
	had been your certainty”
	which appears to make more sense. FIP retains only the second reading. In the
	Notes we find the
	substitution of “presence” for “opposite.”

	IV‐9
	seems to be forever sinful. Where is hope while sin is seen as
	outside? What remedy can guilt expect? But seen within your mind,
	guilt and forgiveness for an instant lie together, side by side, upon
	one altar. There at last are sickness and its single remedy joined in
	one healing brightness. God has come to claim His Own.
	Forgiveness is complete. U(9)
	U 5 <em>a</em> 7. And now Godʹs KNOWLEDGE, changeless, certain, pure
	and wholly understandable, enters its Kingdom. Gone is
	perception, false and true alike. Gone is forgiveness, for its task is
	done. And gone are bodies in the blazing light upon the altar to the
	Son of God. God knows it is His Own, as it is his. And here They
	join, for here the face of Christ has shone away timeʹs final instant,
	and now is the last perception of the world without a purpose and
	without a cause. For where Godʹs memory has come at last there is
	no journey, no belief in sin, no walls, no bodies, and the grim appeal
	of guilt and death is there snuffed out forever.
	U 5 <em>a</em> 8. Oh my brothers, if you only knew the peace that will
	envelop you and hold you safe and pure and lovely in the Mind of
	God, you could but rush to meet Him where His altar is. Hallowed
	your Name and His,11 for they are joined here in this holy place.
	Here He leans down to lift you back to Him, out of illusions into
	holiness; out of the world and into timelessness12; out of all fear and
	given back to Love.
	6. JESUS ‐ CHRIST
	U 6 <em>a</em> 1. There is no need for help to enter Heaven for you never
	left. But there is need for help beyond yourself as you are
	circumscribed by false beliefs about your Identity, Which God alone
	established in reality. Helpers are given you in many forms,
	although upon the altar They are one. Beyond each one there is a
	Thought of God, and this will never change. But they have names
	which differ for a time, for time needs symbols, being itself unreal.
	11 Matthew 6:9 “In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven,
	Hallowed be Your name.”
	12 In the manuscript “into timelessness” is crossed out and “to eternity” is
	typed in above it. The Notes
	has “timelessness.”

	Their names are legion,13 but we will not go beyond the names the
	course itself employs. God does not help because He knows no
	need. But He creates all Helpers of His Son while he believes his
	fantasies are true. Thank God for them for they will lead you home.
	U(10)
	U 6 <em>a</em> 2. The Name of Jesus is the Name of one who was a man but
	saw the face of Christ in all his brothers and remembered God. So
	he became identified with Christ, a man no longer, but at one with
	God. The man was an illusion, for he seemed to be a separate being,
	walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self
	from Self, as all illusions do. Yet who can save unless he sees
	illusions and then identifies them as what they are? Jesus remains a
	Saviour because he saw the false without accepting it as true. And
	Christ needed his form that He might appear to men and save them
	from their own illusions.
	U 6 <em>a</em> 3. In his complete identification with the Christ‐‐the perfect
	Son of God, His one creation and His happiness, forever like
	Himself and One with Him – Jesus became what all of us must be.
	He led the way for us to follow him. He leads us back to God
	because he saw the road before him, and he followed it. He made a
	clean distinction, still obscure to us, between the false and true. He
	offered us all a final demonstration that14 it is impossible to kill
	Godʹs Son; nor can his life in any way be changed by sin and evil,
	malice, fear or death.
	U 6 <em>a</em> 4. And therefore all your sins have been forgiven15 because
	they carried no effects at all. And so they were but dreams. Arise
	with him who showed you this because you owe him this who
	shared your dreams that they might be dispelled. And shares them
	still, to be at one with you.
	13 Mark 5:9 “Then He asked him, ‘What is your name?’ And he answered, saying,
	‘My name is
	Legion; for we are many.’”
	14 The word “that” is handwritten at the end of the line. The Notes just has
	the glyph for “it is.”
	15 The word “you” is originally typed here and then crossed out. In the Notes
	the glyph for “you”
	appears above the line, as if it were an afterthought.

	U 6 <em>a</em> 5. Is he the Christ? Oh yes, along with you. His little life on
	earth was not enough to teach the mighty lesson that he learned for
	all of us. He will remain with you to lead you from the hell you
	made to God. And when you join your will with his, your sight will
	be his vision, for the eyes of Christ are shared. Walking with him is
	just as natural as walking with a brother whom you knew since you
	were born, for such indeed he is. Some bitter idols have been made
	of him who would be only brother to the world. Forgive him your
	illusions, and behold how dear a brother he would be to you. For he
	will set your mind at rest at last and carry it with you unto your
	God. U(11)
	U 6 <em>a</em> 6. Is he Godʹs only Helper? No, indeed. For Christ takes
	many forms with different names until their oneness can be
	recognised. But Jesus is for you the bearer of Christʹs single
	message of the Love of God. You need no other. It is possible to
	read his words and benefit from them without accepting him into
	your life. Yet he would help you yet a little more if you will share
	your pains and joys with him, and leave them both to find the peace
	of God. Yet still it is his lesson most of all that he would have you
	learn, and it is this:
	“There is no death16 because the Son of God is like his Father. Nothing
	you can do can change Eternal Love. Forget your dreams of sin and
	guilt, and come with me instead to share the resurrection of Godʹs Son.
	And bring with you all those whom He has sent to you to care for as I
	care for you.”
	7. <em>the</em> HOLY SPIRIT
	U 7 <em>a</em> 1. Jesus is the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, Whom he
	called down upon the earth after he ascended into Heaven,17 or
	became completely identified with the Christ, the Son of God as He
	16 2 Timothy 1:10 “But has now been revealed by the appearing of our Saviour
	Jesus Christ, who has
	abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,”
	17 Acts 1:8-9 “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
	you; and you shall be
	witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of
	the earth. Now when He

	created Him. The Holy Spirit, being a creation of the one Creator,
	creating with Him and in His likeness or Spirit, is eternal and has
	never changed.18 He was ʺcalled down upon the earth”19 in the
	sense that it was now possible to accept Him and to hear His Voice.
	His is the Voice for God, and has therefore taken form. This form is
	not His reality, which God alone knows along with Christ, His real
	Son, Who is part of Him.
	U 7 <em>a</em> 2. The Holy Spirit is described throughout the course as
	giving us the answer to the separation and bringing the plan of the
	Atonement to us, establishing our particular part in it and showing
	us exactly what it is. He has established Jesus as the leader in
	carrying out this plan since he was the first to complete his own part
	perfectly. All power in Heaven and earth is therefore given him and
	he will share it with you when you have completed yours. 20 The
	Atonement principle was given to the Holy Spirit long before Jesus
	set it in motion.
	U 7 <em>a</em> 3. The Holy Spirit is described as the remaining
	communication link between God and His separated sons. In order
	to fulfill this special function the Holy Spirit has assumed a dual
	function. He knows because He is part of God; He perceives
	because He U(12) was sent to save humanity. He is the great
	correction principle; the bringer of true perception, the inherent
	power of the vision of Christ. He is the light in which the forgiven
	world is perceived; in which the face of Christ alone is seen. He
	never forgets the Creator or His Creation. He never forgets the Son
	of God. He never forgets you. And He brings the Love of your
	Father to you in an eternal shining that will never be obliterated
	because God has put it there.
	18 Isaiah 40:28 Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the everlasting
	God, the Lord, the
	Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow weak nor weary? There is no
	searching of His
	understanding.

	U 7 <em>a</em> 4. The Holy Spirit abides in the part of your mind that is part
	of the Christ Mind. He represents your Self and your Creator, Who
	are One. He speaks for God and also for you, being joined with
	both. And therefore it is He Who proves them One. He seems to be
	a Voice, for in that form He speaks Godʹs Word to you. He seems to
	be a Guide through a far country, for you need that form of help.21
	He seems to be whatever meets the needs you think you have. But
	He is not deceived when you perceive your self entrapped in needs
	you do not have. It is from these He would deliver you. It is from
	these that He would make you safe.
	U 7 <em>a</em> 5. You are His manifestation in this world. Your brother calls
	to you to be His Voice along with him. Alone he cannot be the
	Helper of Godʹs Son for he alone is functionless. But joined with
	you he is the shining Saviour of the world, Whose part in its
	redemption you have made complete. He offers thanks to you as
	well as him for you arose with him when he began to save the
	world. And you will be with him when time is over, and no trace
	remains of dreams of spite in which you dance to deathʹs thin
	melody. For in its place the hymn to God is heard a little while.
	And then the Voice is gone, no longer to take form but to return to
	the eternal Formlessness of God. U(13)

	the ending sure. No‐one can fail to do what God appointed him to

	long ago begun that but seems new. We have begun again upon a
	road we travelled on before and lost our way a little while. And
	now we try again. Our new beginning has the certainty the journey
	lacked ’til now. Look up and see His Word among the stars, where
	He has set your Name along with His. Look up and find your
	certain destiny the world would hide but God would have you see.
	U 8 <em>a</em> 5. Let us wait here in silence, and kneel down an instant in
	our gratitude to Him Who called to us and helped us hear His Call.
	And then let us arise and go in faith along the way to Him. Now we
	are sure we do not walk alone. For God is here, and with Him all
	our brothers. Now we know that we will never lose the way again.
	The song begins again which had been stopped26 only an instant,
	though it seems to be unsung forever. What is here begun will grow
	in life and strength and hope, until the world is still U(14) an instant
	and forgets all that the dream of sin had made of it.

	1. <em>an</em> INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOTHERAPY
	P 1 <em>a</em> 1. Psychotherapy is the only form of therapy there is. Since
	only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed. Only the
	mind is in need of healing. This does not appear to be the case, for
	the manifestations of this world seem real indeed. Psychotherapy is
	necessary so that an individual1 can begin to question his reality.
	Sometimes he is able to start to open his mind without formal help,
	but even then it is always some change in his perception of
	interpersonal relationships that enables him to do so. Sometimes he
	needs a more structured, extended relationship with an ʺofficialʺ
	therapist. Either way, the task is the same; the patient must be
	helped to change his mind about the ʺrealityʺ of illusions.
	2. <em>the purpose of</em> PSYCHOTHERAPY
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	P 2 <em>a</em> 1. Very simply, the purpose of psychotherapy is to remove the
	blocks to truth. Its aim is to aid the patient in abandoning his fixed
	delusional system, and to begin to reconsider the spurious cause
	and effect relationships on which it rests. No‐one in this world
	escapes fear, but everyone can reconsider its causes and learn to
	evaluate them correctly. God has given everyone a Teacher Whose
	wisdom and help far exceed whatever contributions an earthly
	1 The Urtext manuscript has “an individual can begin to question their
	reality.” FIP keeps that reading.
	Grammar requires that “an individual question his reality” or “individuals
	question their reality.”
	When this was written in the mid-1970s the modern habit of using “their” when
	“his” or “her” would be
	correct in order to achieve “gender-neutral language” had not come into vogue.
	The Notes has the
	abbreviation indiv. which could be either plural or singular and it clearly
	has the glyph for “their”
	rather than “his” four words later. Just before indiv. the Notes has a letter
	or glyph, possibly the glyph
	for “an” crossed out with a dash above it, that dash often being the glyph for
	“the” but also sometimes
	other things. That could be intended as “the individual” and might originally
	have been “an individual.”
	However it could also just be noise with the intended meaning simply being
	“individuals” and that is
	the only option which keeps the subject plural to fit with the subsequent
	unambiguous “their.”

	therapist can provide. Yet there are times and situations in which
	the2 patient‐therapist relationship becomes the means through
	which He offers His greater gifts to both.
	P 2 <em>a</em> 2. What better3 purpose could any relationship have than to
	invite the Holy Spirit to enter into it and give it His Own great gift
	of rejoicing? What higher goal could there be for anyone than to
	learn to call upon God and hear His Answer? And what more
	transcendent aim can there be than to recall the Way, the Truth and
	the Life,4 and to remember God? To help in this is the proper
	purpose of psychotherapy. Could anything be holier? For
	psychotherapy, correctly understood, teaches forgiveness and helps
	the patient to recognise and accept it. And in his healing is the
	therapist forgiven with him. P(2)
	P 2 <em>a</em> 3. Everyone who needs help, regardless of the form of his
	distress, is attacking himself, and his peace of mind is suffering in
	consequence. These tendencies are often described as ʺselfdestructive,
	ʺ and the patient often regards them in that way himself.
	What he does not realise and needs to learn is that this ʺself,ʺ which
	can attack and be attacked as well, is a concept he made up.
	Further, he cherishes it, defends it, and is sometimes even willing to
	ʺsacrificeʺ his ʺlifeʺ on its behalf. For he regards it as himself. This
	self he sees as being acted on, reäcting to external forces as they
	demand, and helpless in5 the power of the world.
	P 2 <em>a</em> 4. Psychotherapy, then, must restore to his awareness the
	ability to make his own decisions. He must become willing to
	reverse his thinking, and to understand that what he thought
	projected its effects on him were made by his projections on the
	world. The world he sees does therefore not exist. Until this is at
	least in part accepted, the patient cannot see himself as really
	2 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “the” to “an earthly.” That is not
	present in the Notes.
	3 The Notes has “greater” rather than “better.”
	4 Urtext manuscript has “Light”, handwritten mark-up corrects this Biblical
	quote to “Life”. This is also
	the reading in the Notes. John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the
	truth, and the life. No one
	comes to the Father except through Me.”
	5 FIP replaces “in” with “midst.” The Notes reads “in.”

	capable of making decisions. And he will fight against his freedom
	because he thinks that it is slavery.
	P 2 <em>a</em> 5. The patient need not think of truth as God in order to make
	progress in salvation. But he must begin to separate truth from
	illusion, recognising that they are not the same, and becoming
	increasingly willing to see illusions as illusions6 and to accept the
	truth as true. His Teacher will take him on from there, as far as he is
	ready to go. Psychotherapy can only save him time. The Holy
	Spirit uses time as He thinks best, and He is never wrong.
	Psychotherapy under His direction is one of the means He uses to
	save time, and to prepare additional teachers for His work. There is
	no end to the help that He begins and He directs. By whatever
	routes He chooses, all psychotherapy leads to God in the end. But
	that is up to Him. We are all His psychotherapists, for He would
	have us all be healed in Him. P(3)
	3. <em>the</em> PROCESS <em>of</em> PSYCHOTHERAPY
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	P 3 <em>a</em> 1. Psychotherapy is a process that changes the view of the
	self.
	At best this ʺnewʺ self is a more beneficent self‐concept, but
	psychotherapy can hardly be expected to establish reality. That is
	not its function. If it can make way for reality, it has achieved its
	ultimate success. Its whole function, in the end, is to help the
	patient deal with one fundamental error; the belief that anger brings
	him something he really wants, and that by justifying attack he is
	protecting himself. To whatever extent he comes to realise that this
	is mistaken,7 to that extent is he truly saved.
	P 3 <em>a</em> 2. Patients do not enter the therapeutic relationship with this
	goal in mind. On the contrary, such concepts mean little to them, or
	they would not need help. Their aim is to be able to retain their selfconcept
	exactly as it is, but without the suffering that it entails.
	6 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace “illusions” with “false.” The Notes has
	“illusions.”
	7 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “mistaken” to “error.” The Notes omits
	the word entirely,
	reading “to whatever extent he comes to realise this, to that extent he is
	truly saved.”
	PROOF COPY 1761

	V‐4
	Their whole equilibrium rests on the insane belief that this is
	possible. And because to the sane mind it is so clearly impossible,
	what they seek is magic. In illusions the impossible is easily
	accomplished, but only at the cost of making illusions true. The
	patient has already paid this price. Now he wants a ʺbetterʺ illusion.
	P 3 <em>a</em> 3. At the beginning, then, the patientʹs goal and the
	therapistʹs
	are at variance. The therapist as well as the patient may cherish
	false self‐concepts, but their respective perceptions of
	ʺimprovementʺ still must differ. The patient hopes to learn how to
	get the changes he wants without changing his self‐concept to any
	significant extent. He hopes, in fact, to stabilize it sufficiently to
	include within it the magical powers he seeks in psychotherapy. He
	wants to make the vulnerable invulnerable and the finite limitless.
	The self he sees is his god, and he seeks only to serve it better.
	P 3 <em>a</em> 4. Regardless of how advanced8 the therapist himself may be,
	he must want to change the patientʹs self‐concept in some way that
	he believes is real. The task of therapy is one of reconciling these
	differences. Hopefully, both will learn to give up their original
	goals, for it is only in relationships that salvation can be found. At
	the beginning, it is inevitable that patients and therapists alike
	accept unrealistic goals not completely free of magical overtones.
	P(4) They are finally given up in the minds of both.
	B. The Limits on Psychotherapy
	P 3 B 1. Yet the ideal outcome is rarely achieved. But psychotherapy9
	begins with the realisation that healing is of the mind, and in
	psychotherapy those have come together who10 believe this. It may
	be they will not get much further, for no‐one learns beyond his own
	readiness. Yet levels of readiness change, and when therapist or
	patient has reached the next one, there will be a relationship held
	out to them that meets the changing need. Perhaps they will come
	8 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “advanced” to “sincere.” The Notes has
	“advanced.”
	9 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace “But psychotherapy” with “Therapy.” The
	Notes has “But
	therapy.”
	10 Handwritten mark-up and FIP insert “already.” The Notes doesn’t.

	V‐5
	together again and advance in the same relationship, making it
	holier. Or perhaps each of them will enter into another
	commitment. Be assured of this; each will progress. Retrogression
	is temporary. The overall direction is one of progress toward the
	truth.
	P 3 B 2. Psychotherapy itself cannot be creative. This is one of the
	errors which the ego fosters; that it is capable of true change, and
	therefore of true creativity. When we speak of ʺthe saving illusionʺ
	or ʺthe final dream,ʺ this is not what we mean, but here is the egoʹs
	last defence. ʺResistanceʺ is its way of looking at things; its
	interpretation of “progress”11 and “growth.”12 These interpretations
	will be wrong of necessity, because they are delusional. The
	“changes”13 the ego seeks to make are not really changes. They are
	but deeper shadows, or perhaps different cloud patterns. Yet what
	is made of nothingness cannot be called new or different. Illusions
	are illusions; truth is truth.
	P 3 B 3. Resistance as defined here14 can be characteristic of a
	therapist as well as of a patient. Either way, it sets a limit on
	psychotherapy because it restricts its aims. Nor can the Holy Spirit
	fight against the intrusions of the ego on the therapeutic process.
	But He will wait, and His patience is infinite. His goal is wholly
	undivided always. Whatever resolutions patient and therapist reach
	in connection with their own divergent goals, they cannot become
	completely reconciled as one until they join with His. Only then is
	all conflict over, for only then can there be certainty. P(5)
	P 3 B 4. Ideally, psychotherapy is a series of holy encounters in which
	brothers meet to bless each other and to receive the peace of God.
	And this will one day come to pass for every ʺpatientʺ on the face of
	this earth, for who except a patient could possibly have come here?

	He learns through teaching, and the more advanced he is the more

	he teaches and the more he learns. But whatever stage he is in, there
	are patients who need him just that way. They cannot take more
	than he can give for now. Yet they15 both will find sanity at last.
	C. The Place of Religion in Psychotherapy16
	P 3 C 1. To be a Teacher of God, it is not necessary to be religious or
	even to believe in God to any recognizable extent. It is necessary,
	however, to teach forgiveness rather than condemnation. Even in
	this, complete consistency is not required, for one who has17
	achieved that point can18 teach salvation completely, within an
	instant and without a word. Yet he who has learned all things does
	not need a teacher, and the healed have no need for a therapist.
	Relationships are still the Temple19 of the Holy Spirit,20 and they will
	be made perfect in time and restored to Eternity.21
	P 3 C 2. Formal religion has no place in psychotherapy, but it also has
	no real place in religion. In this world, there is an astonishing
	tendency to join contradictory words into one term without
	perceiving the contradiction at all. The attempt to formalize religion
	is so obviously an ego attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable that it
	hardly requires elaboration here. Religion is experience;
	psychotherapy is experience. At the highest levels they become one.
	Neither is truth itself, but both can lead to truth. What can be
	necessary to find truth, which remains perfectly obvious, but to
	remove the seeming obstacles to true awareness? P(6)
	15 Handwritten mark-up and FIP delete “they.” The word is present in the
	Notes.
	16 This heading is originally typed at the end of the paragraph; mark-up
	suggests moving it, as we have
	done. However, in the Notes it also occurs at the end of paragraph P 3 C 1,
	which would make that
	paragraph P 3 B 5. It appears from the context that moving the section break
	is warranted, as this
	paragraph introduces the topic of the following section.
	17 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace “has” with “had,” making the sentence
	shift from present to
	past tense half way through, a most curious alteration. In the Notes it is
	“has.”
	18 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace “can” with “could.” In the Notes it is
	“can.”
	19 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change this to lower case, but in the Notes it
	is upper case “Temple.”
	20 1 Corinthians 6:19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the
	Holy Spirit who is in
	you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 1 Corinthians 3:16 Do
	you not know that
	you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
	21 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change “Eternity” to lower case, but in the
	Notes it is upper case.
	PROOF COPY 1764

	V‐7
	P 3 C 3. No‐one who learns to forgive can fail to remember God.
	Forgiveness, then, is all that need be taught, because it is all that
	need be learned. All blocks to the remembrance of God are forms of
	unforgiveness, and nothing else. This is never apparent to the
	patient, and only rarely so to the therapist. The world has
	marshalled22 all its forces against this one awareness, for in it lies the
	ending of the world and all it stands for.
	P 3 C 4. Yet it is not the awareness of God that constitutes a
	reasonable goal for psychotherapy. This will come when
	psychotherapy is complete, for where there is forgiveness truth
	must come. It would be unfair indeed if belief in God were
	necessary to psychotherapeutic success. Nor is belief in God a really
	meaningful concept, for God can be but known. Belief implies that
	unbelief is possible, but knowledge of God has no true opposite.
	Not to know God is to have no knowledge, and it is to this that all
	unforgiveness leads. And without knowledge one can have only
	belief.
	P 3 C 5. Different teaching aids appeal to different people. Some
	forms of religion have nothing to do with God, and some forms of
	psychotherapy have nothing to do with healing. Yet if pupil and
	teacher join in sharing one goal, God will enter into their
	relationship because He has been invited to come in. In the same
	way, a union of purpose between patient and therapist restores the
	place of God to ascendance, first through Christʹs vision and then
	through the memory of God Himself. The process of psychotherapy
	is the return to sanity. Teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, are
	all insane or they would not be here. Together they can find a
	pathway out, for no‐one will find sanity alone. P(7)
	P 3 C 6. If healing is an invitation to God to enter into His Kingdom,
	what difference does it make how the invitation is written? Does
	the paper matter, or the ink, or the pen? Or is it he who writes that
	gives the invitation? God comes to those who would restore His

	world, for they have found the way to call to Him. If any two are
	joined, He must be there.23 It does not matter what their purpose is,
	but they must share it wholly to succeed. It is impossible to share a
	goal not blessed by Christ, for what is unseen through His eyes is
	too fragmented to be meaningful.
	P 3 C 7. As true religion heals, so must true psychotherapy be
	religious. But both have many forms, because no true24 teacher uses
	one approach to every pupil. On the contrary, he listens patiently to
	each one, and lets him formulate his own curriculum; not the
	curriculumʹs goal, but how he can best reach the aim it sets for him.
	Perhaps the teacher does not think of God as part of teaching.
	Perhaps the psychotherapist does not understand that healing
	comes from God. They can succeed where many who believe they
	have found God will fail.
	P 3 C 8. What must the teacher do to ensure learning? What must the
	therapist do to bring healing about? Only one thing; the same
	requirement salvation asks of everyone. Each one must share one
	goal with someone else, and in so doing, lose all sense of separate
	interests. Only by doing this is it possible to transcend the narrow
	boundaries the ego would impose upon the self. Only by doing this
	can teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, you and I, accept
	Atonement and learn to give it as it was received.
	P 3 C 9. Communion is impossible alone. No‐one who stands apart
	can receive Christʹs vision. It is held out to him, but he cannot hold
	out his hand to receive it. Let him be still and recognise his
	brotherʹs need is his own.25 And let him then meet his brotherʹs
	need as his and see that they are met as one, for such they are. What
	is religion but an aid in helping him to see that this is so? And what
	is psychotherapy except a help in just this same direction? It is the

	goal that makes these processes the same, for they are one in
	purpose and must thus be one in means. P(8)
	D. The Role of the Psychotherapist
	P 3 D 1. The psychotherapist is a leader in the sense that he walks
	slightly ahead of the patient, and helps him to avoid a few of the
	pitfalls along the road by seeing them first. Ideally, he is also a
	follower, for One should walk ahead of him to give him light to see.
	Without this One, both will merely stumble blindly on to nowhere.
	It is, however, impossible that this One be wholly absent if the goal
	is healing. He may, however, not be recognised. And so the little
	light that can be then accepted is all there is to light the way to truth.
	P 3 D 2. Healing is limited by the limitations of the psychotherapist,
	as it is limited by those of the patient. The aim of the process,
	therefore, is to transcend these limits. Neither can do this alone, but
	when they join, the potentiality for transcending all limitations has
	been given them. Now the extent of their success depends on how
	much of this potentiality they are willing to use. The willingness
	may come from either one at the beginning, and as the other shares
	it, it will grow. Progress becomes a matter of decision; it can reach
	almost to Heaven or go no further than a step or two from hell.
	P 3 D 3. It is quite possible for psychotherapy26 to seem to fail. It is
	even possible for the result to look like retrogression. But in the end
	there must be some success. One asks for help; another hears and
	tries to answer in the form of help. This is the formula for salvation,
	and must heal. Divided goals alone can interfere with perfect
	healing. One wholly egoless therapist could heal the world without
	a word, merely by being there. No‐one need see him or talk to him
	or even know of his existence. His simple Presence is enough to
	heal.
	26 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace the originally typed “the
	psychotherapist” with
	“psychotherapy.” While the Notes reading is slightly ambiguous,
	“psychotherapy” appears as the most
	probable reading.

	P 3 D 4. The ideal therapist is one with Christ. But healing is a
	process, not a fact. The therapist cannot progress without the
	patient, and the patient cannot be ready to receive the Christ or he
	could not be sick. In a sense, the egoless psychotherapist is an
	abstraction that stands at the end of the process of healing, too
	advanced to believe in sickness and too near to God to keep his feet
	on earth. Now he can help through those in need of help, for thus
	he carries out the plan established for salvation. P(9) The
	psychotherapist becomes his patient, working through other
	patients to express his thoughts as he receives them from the Mind
	of Christ.
	E. The Process of Illness
	P 3 E 1. As all therapy is psychotherapy, so all illness is mental
	illness. It is a judgement on the Son of God, and judgement is a
	mental activity. Judgement is a decision, made again and again,
	against creation and its Creator. It is a decision to perceive the
	universe as you would have created it. It is a decision that truth can
	lie and must be lies. What, then, can illness be except an expression
	of sorrow and of guilt? And who could weep but for his innocence?
	P 3 E 2. Once Godʹs Son is seen as guilty, illness becomes inevitable.
	It has been asked for and will be received.27 And all who ask for
	illness have now condemned themselves to seek for remedies that
	cannot help, because their faith is in the illness and not in salvation.
	There can be nothing that a change of mind cannot effect, for all
	external things are only shadows of a decision already made.
	Change the decision, and how can its shadow be unchanged?
	Illness can be but guiltʹs shadow, grotesque and ugly since it mimics
	deformity. If a deformity is seen as real, what could its shadow be
	except deformed?28
	27 Matthew 7:7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be opened
	to you.”
	28 The Urtext manuscript originally has “the form” here. Handwritten mark-up
	and FIP change this to
	“deformed” which restores the reading to that found in the Notes.
	PROOF COPY 1768
	Volume V Psychotherapy
	V‐11
	P 3 E 3. The descent into hell follows step by step in an inevitable
	course, once the decision that guilt is real has been made. Sickness
	and death and misery now stalk the earth in unrelenting waves,
	sometimes together and sometimes in grim succession. Yet all these
	things, however real they seem, are but illusions. Who could have
	faith in them once this is realised? And who could not have faith in
	them until he realises this? Healing is therapy or correction, and we
	have said already and will say again, all therapy is psychotherapy.
	To heal the sick is but to bring this realisation to them.
	P 3 E 4. The word ʺcureʺ has come into disrepute among the more
	ʺrespectableʺ therapists of the world, and justly so. For not one of
	them can cure, and not one of them understands healing. At
	worst,29 they but make the body real in their own minds, and having
	done so, seek for magic by which to heal the ills with which their
	minds endow it. P(10) How could such a process cure? It is
	ridiculous from start to finish. Yet having started, it must finish
	thus. It is as if God were the devil and must be found in evil. How
	could love be there? And how could sickness cure? Are not these
	both one question?
	P 3 E 5. At best, and the word is perhaps questionable here, the
	ʺhealersʺ of the world may recognise the mind as the source of
	illness. But their error lies in the belief that it can cure itself. This
	has some merit in a world where ʺdegrees of errorʺ is a meaningful
	concept. Yet must their cures remain temporary, or another illness
	rise30 instead, for death has not been overcome until the meaning of
	love is understood. And who can understand this without the Word
	of God, given by Him to the Holy Spirit as His gift to you?
	P 3 E 6. Illness of any kind may be defined as the result of a view of
	the self as weak, vulnerable, evil and endangered, and thus in need
	of constant defence. Yet if such were really the self, defence would
	be impossible. Therefore, the defences sought for must be magical.

	restores the reading to that
	found in the Notes.

	They must overcome all limits perceived in the self, at the same time
	making a new self‐concept into which they31 cannot return. In a
	word, error is accepted as real and dealt with by illusions. Truth
	being brought to illusions, reality now becomes a threat and is
	perceived as evil. Love becomes feared because reality is love. Thus
	is the circle closed against the ʺinroadsʺ of salvation.
	P 3 E 7. Illness is therefore a mistake and needs correction. And as
	we have already <em>emphasised</em> before,32 correction cannot be achieved
	by first establishing the ʺrightnessʺ of the mistake and then
	overlooking it. If illness is real it cannot be overlooked in truth, for33
	to overlook reality is insanity. Yet that is magicʹs purpose; to make
	illusions true through false perception. This cannot heal, for it
	opposes truth. Perhaps an illusion of health is substituted for a little
	while, but not for long. Fear cannot long be hidden by illusions, for
	it is part of them. It will escape and take another form, being the
	source of all illusions. P(11)
	P 3 E 8. Sickness is insanity because all sickness is mental illness, and
	in it there are no degrees. One of the illusions by which sickness is
	perceived as real is the belief that illness varies in intensity; that the
	degree of threat differs according to the form it takes. Herein lies
	the basis of all errors,34 for all of them are but attempts to
	compromise by seeing just a little bit of hell. This is a mockery so
	alien to God that it must be forever inconceivable. But the insane
	believe it because they are insane.
	P 3 E 9. A madman will defend his own illusions because in them he
	sees his own salvation. Thus, he will attack the one who tries to
	save him from them, believing that he is attacking him. This curious
	circle of attack‐defence is one of the most difficult problems with
	which the psychotherapist must deal. In fact, this is his central task;

	the core of psychotherapy. The therapist is seen as one who is
	attacking the patientʹs most cherished possession; his picture of
	himself. And since this picture has become the patientʹs security as
	he perceives it, the therapist cannot but be seen as a real source of
	danger, to be attacked and even killed.
	P 3 E 10. The psychotherapist, then, has a tremendous responsibility.
	He must meet attack without attack, and therefore without defence.
	It is his task to demonstrate that defences are not necessary, and that
	defenselessness is strength. This must be his teaching, if his lesson
	is to be that sanity is safe. It cannot be too strongly <em>emphasised</em>
	that
	the insane believe that sanity is threat. This is the corollary of the
	“original sin”; the belief that guilt is real and fully justified. It is
	therefore the psychotherapist’s function to teach that guilt, being
	unreal, cannot be justified. But neither is it safe. And thus it must
	remain unwanted as well as unreal.
	P 3 E 11. Salvation’s single doctrine is the goal of all therapy. Relieve
	the mind of the insane burden of guilt it carries so wearily, and
	healing is accomplished. The body is not cured. It is merely
	recognised as what it is. Seen rightly, its purpose can be
	understood. What is the need for sickness then? Given this single
	shift, all else will follow. There is no need for complicated change.
	There is no need for long analyses and wearying discussions and
	pursuits. The truth is simple, being one for all. P(12)
	F. The Process of Healing
	P 3 F 1. While truth is simple, it must still be taught to those who
	have already lost their way in endless mazes of complexity. This is
	the great illusion. In its wake comes the inevitable belief that, to be
	safe, one must control the unknown. This strange belief relies on
	certain steps which never reach to consciousness. First, it is ushered
	in by the belief that there are forces to be overcome to be alive at all.
	And next, it seems as if these forces can be held at bay only by an
	inflated sense of self that holds in darkness what is truly felt, and
	seeks to raise illusions to the light.
	PROOF COPY 1771

	P 3 F 2. Let us remember that the ones who come to us for help are
	bitterly afraid. What they believe will help can only harm; what
	they believe will harm alone can help. Progress becomes impossible
	until the patient is persuaded to reverse his twisted way of looking
	at the world; his twisted way of looking at himself. The truth is
	simple. Yet it must be taught to those who think it will endanger
	them. It must be taught to those who will attack because they feel
	endangered, and to those who need the lesson of defenselessness
	above all else, to show them what is strength.
	P 3 F 3. If this world were ideal, there could perhaps be ideal therapy.
	And yet it would be useless in an ideal state. We speak of ideal
	teaching in a world in which the perfect teacher could not long
	remain; the perfect psychotherapist is but a glimmer of a thought
	not yet conceived. But still we speak of what can yet be done in
	helping the insane within the bounds of the attainable. While they
	are sick, they can and must be helped. No more than that is asked
	of psychotherapy; no less than all he has to give is worthy of the
	therapist. For God Himself holds out his brother as his Saviour35
	from the world.
	P 3 F 4. Healing is holy. Nothing in the world is holier than helping
	one who asks for help. And two come very close to God in this
	attempt, however limited, however lacking in sincerity. Where two
	have joined for healing, God is there. And He has guaranteed that
	He will hear and answer them in truth. They can be sure that
	healing is a process He directs, because it is according to His Will.
	We have His Word to guide us, as we try to help our brothers. Let
	us not forget that we are helpless of ourselves, and lean upon a
	strength beyond our little scope for what to teach as well as what to
	learn.36 P(13)

	manner.”

	P 3 F 5. A brother seeking aid can bring us gifts beyond the heights
	perceived in any dream. He offers us salvation, for he comes to us
	as Christ and Saviour. What he asks is asked by God through him.
	And what we do for him becomes the gift we give to37 God. The
	sacred calling of Godʹs holy Son for help in his perceived distress
	can be but answered by his Father. Yet He needs a voice through
	which to speak His holy Word; a hand to reach His Son and touch
	his heart. In such a process, who could not be healed? This holy
	interaction is the plan of God Himself, by which His Son is saved.
	P 3 F 6. For two have joined. And now Godʹs promises are kept by
	Him. The limits laid on both the patient and the therapist will count
	as nothing, for the healing has begun. What man38 must start his39
	Father will complete. For He has never asked for more than just the
	smallest willingness, the least advance, the tiniest of whispers of His
	Name. To ask for help, whatever form it takes, is but to call on Him.
	And He will send His Answer through the therapist who best can
	serve His Son in all his present needs. Perhaps the answer does not
	seem to be a gift from Heaven. It may even seem to be a worsening
	and not a help. Yet let the outcome not be judged by us.
	P 3 F 7. Somewhere all gifts of God must be received. In time no
	effort can be made in vain. It is not our perfection that is asked in
	our attempts to heal. We are deceived already, if we think there is a
	need of healing. And the truth will come to us only through one
	who seems to share our dream of sickness. Let us help him to
	forgive himself for all the trespasses with which he would condemn
	himself without a cause.40 His healing is our own. And as we see

	where all dreams began. And it is there that we will lay them down,
	to come away in peace forever. Hear a brother call for help and
	answer him. It will be God to Whom you answer, for you called on
	Him. There is no other way to hear His Voice. There is no other
	way to seek44 His Son. There is no other way to find45 your Self.
	Holy is healing, for the Son of God returns to Heaven through its
	kind embrace. For healing tells him, in the Voice of46 God, that all47
	his sins have been forgiven him.48 P(14)
	G. The Definition of Healing
	P 3 G 1. The process of psychotherapy, then, can be defined simply as
	forgiveness, for no healing can be anything else. The unforgiving
	are sick, believing they are unforgiven. The hanging‐on to guilt, its
	hugging‐close and sheltering, its loving protection and alert defence,
	‐‐ all this is but the grim refusal to forgive. ʺGod may not enter
	hereʺ the sick repeat, over and over, while they mourn their loss and
	yet rejoice in it. Healing occurs as a patient begins to hear the dirge
	he sings, and questions its validity. Until he hears it, he cannot
	understand that it is he who sings it to himself. To hear it is the first
	step in recovery. To question it must then become his choice.

	P 3 G 2. There is a tendency, and it is very strong, to hear this song of
	death49 an instant, and then dismiss it uncorrected. These fleeting
	awarenesses represent the many opportunities given us literally ʺto
	change our tune.ʺ The sound of healing can be heard instead. But
	first the willingness to question the ʺtruthʺ of the song of
	condemnation must arise. The strange distortions woven
	inextricably into the self‐concept, itself but a “pseudo‐creation,”50
	make this ugly sound seem truly beautiful. ʺThe rhythm of the
	universe,ʺ ʺthe herald angelʹs song,ʺ all these and more are heard
	instead of loud discordant shrieks.
	P 3 G 3. The ear translates; it does not hear. The eye reproduces; it
	does not see. Their task is to make agreeable whatever is called on,
	however disagreeable it may be. They answer the decisions of the
	mind, reproducing its desires and translating them into acceptable
	and pleasant forms. Sometimes the thought behind the form breaks
	through, but only very briefly, and the mind grows fearful and
	begins to doubt its sanity. Yet it will not permit its slaves to change
	the forms they look upon; the sounds they hear. These are its
	ʺremediesʺ; its ʺsafeguardsʺ from insanity.
	P 3 G 4. These testimonies which the senses bring have but one
	purpose; to justify attack and thus keep unforgiveness unrecognized
	for what it is. Seen undisguised it is intolerable. Without protection
	it could not endure. Here is all sickness cherished, but without the
	recognition that this is so. For when an unforgiveness is not
	recognised, the form it takes seems to be something else. And now
	it is the ʺsomething elseʺ that seems to terrify. But it is not the
	ʺsomething elseʺ that can be healed. It is not sick, and P(15) needs no
	remedy. To concentrate your healing efforts here is but futility.
	Who can cure what cannot be sick and make it well?

	careful study of the form a sickness takes will point quite clearly to
	the form of unforgiveness that it represents. Yet seeing this will not
	effect a cure. That is achieved by only one recognition; that only
	forgiveness heals an unforgiveness, and only an unforgiveness can
	possibly give rise to sickness of any kind.
	P 3 G 6. This realisation is the final goal of psychotherapy. How is it
	reached? The therapist sees in the patient all that he has not
	forgiven in himself, and is thus given another chance to look at it,
	open it to re‐evaluation and forgive it. When this occurs, he sees his
	sins as gone into a past that is no longer here. Until he does this, he
	must think of evil as besetting him here and now. The patient is his
	screen for the projection of his sins, enabling him to let them go. Let
	him retain one spot of sin in what he looks upon, and his release is
	partial and will not be sure.
	P 3 G 7. No‐one is healed alone. This is the joyous song salvation
	sings to all who hear its Voice. This statement cannot be too often
	remembered by all who see themselves as therapists. Their patients
	can but be seen as the bringers of forgiveness, for it is they who
	come to demonstrate their sinlessness to eyes that still believe that
	sin is there to look upon. Yet will the proof of sinlessness, seen in
	the patient and accepted in the therapist, offer the mind of both a

	P 3 H 1. Who, then, is the therapist, and who is the patient? In the
	end, everyone is both. He who needs healing must heal.
	“Physician, heal thyself.”51 Who else is there to heal? And who else
	is in need of healing? Each patient who comes to a therapist offers
	him a chance to heal himself. He is therefore his therapist. And
	every therapist must learn to heal from each patient who comes to
	him. He thus becomes his patient. God does not know of separation.
	51 Handwritten mark-up and FIP delete quotation marks. This paragraph has not

	Luke 4:23 He said to them, “You will surely say this proverb to Me,
	‘Physician, heal yourself!
	Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.’”

	What He knows is only that He has one Son. His knowledge is
	reflected in the ideal patient‐therapist relationship. God comes to
	him who calls, and in Him he52 recognises Himself.
	P 3 H 2. Think carefully, teacher and therapist, for whom you pray,
	and who is in need of healing. For therapy is prayer, and healing is
	its aim and its result. What is prayer except the joining of minds in
	a relationship which Christ can enter? This is His home, into which
	psychotherapy invites Him. What is symptom cure, when another
	is always there to choose? But once Christ enters in, what choice is
	there except to have Him stay? There is no need for more than this,
	for it is everything. Healing is here, and happiness and peace.
	These are the ʺsymptomsʺ of the ideal patient‐therapist relationship,
	replacing those with which the patient came to ask for help.
	P 3 H 3. The process that takes place in this relationship is actually
	one in which the therapist in his heart tells the patient that all his
	sins have been forgiven him, along with his own. What could be the
	difference between healing and forgiveness? Only Christ forgives,
	knowing His sinlessness. His vision heals perception and sickness
	disappears. Nor will it return again, once its cause has been
	removed. This, however, needs the help of a very advanced
	therapist, capable of joining with the patient in a holy relationship in
	which all sense of separation finally is overcome.
	P 3 H 4. For this, one thing and one thing only is required: The
	therapist in no way confuses himself with God. All ʺunhealed
	healersʺ make this fundamental confusion in one form or another,
	because they must regard themselves as self‐created rather than
	God‐created. This confusion is rarely if ever in awareness, or the
	unhealed P(17) healer would instantly become a Teacher of God,
	devoting his life to the function of true healing. Before he reached
	this point, he thought he was in charge of the therapeutic process
	and was therefore responsible for its outcome. His patientʹs

	failures53 thus became his own mistakes,54 and guilt became the
	cover, dark and strong, for what should be the Holiness of Christ.
	Guilt is inevitable in those who use their judgement in making their
	decisions. Guilt is impossible in those through whom the Holy
	Spirit speaks.
	P 3 H 5. The passing of guilt is the true aim of therapy and the
	obvious aim of forgiveness. In this their oneness can be clearly seen.
	Yet who could experience the end of guilt who feels responsible for
	his brother in the role of guide for him? Such a function
	presupposes a knowledge that no‐one here can have; a certainty of
	past, present and future, and of all the effects that may occur in
	them. Only from this omniscient point of view would such a role be
	possible. Yet no perception is omniscient, nor is the tiny self of one
	alone against the universe able to assume he has such wisdom
	except in madness. That many therapists are mad is obvious. No
	unhealed healer can be wholly sane.
	P 3 H 6. Yet it is as insane not to accept a function God has given you
	as to invent one He has not. The advanced therapist in no way can
	ever doubt the power that is in him. Nor does he doubt its Source.
	He understands all power in earth and Heaven belongs to him
	because of who he is.55 And he is this because of his Creator, Whose
	Love is in him and Who cannot fail. Think what this means; he has
	the gifts of God Himself to give away. His patients are Godʹs saints,
	who call upon his sanctity to make it theirs. And as he gives it to
	them, they behold Christʹs shining face as it looks back at them.
	P 3 H 7. The insane, thinking they are God, are not afraid to offer
	weakness to the Son of God.56 But what they see in him because of

	this they fear indeed. The unhealed healer cannot but be fearful of
	his patients, and suspect them of the treachery he sees in him. He
	tries to heal, and thus at times he may. But he will not succeed
	except to some extent and for a little while. He does not see the
	Christ in him who calls. P(18) What answer can he give to one who
	seems to be a stranger; alien to the truth and poor in wisdom,
	without the god who must be given him? Behold your God in him,
	for what you see will be your Answer.
	P 3 H 8. Think what the joining of two brothers really means. And
	then forget the world and all its little triumphs and its dreams of
	death. The same are one, and nothing now can be remembered of
	the world of guilt. The room becomes a temple, and the street a
	stream of stardust brushing57 lightly past all sickly dreams. Healing
	is done, for what is perfect needs no healing, and what remains to be
	forgiven where there is no sin?
	P 3 H 9. Be thankful, therapist, that you can see such things as this, if
	you but understand your proper role. But if you fail in that,58 you
	have denied that God created you, and so you will not know you
	are His Son.59 Who is your brother60 now? What saint can come to
	take you home with him? You lost the way. And can you now
	expect to see in him an answer that you have refused to give? Heal
	and be healed. There is no other choice of pathways that can ever
	lead to peace. Oh let your patient in, for he has come to you from
	God. Is not his holiness enough to wake your memory of Him? P(19)

	4. <em>the</em> PRACTICE <em>of</em> PSYCHOTHERAPY
	<em>a</em>. The Selection of Patients
	P 4 <em>a</em> 1. Everyone who is sent to you is a patient of yours. This does
	not mean that you select him, nor that you choose the kind of
	“treatment” that is suitable. But it does mean that no‐one comes to
	you by mistake. There are no errors in Godʹs plan. It would be an
	error, however, to assume that you know what to offer everyone
	who comes. This is not up to you to decide. There is a tendency to
	assume that you are being called on constantly to make sacrifices of
	yourself for those who come. This could hardly be true. To demand
	sacrifice of yourself is to demand a sacrifice of God, and He knows
	nothing of sacrifice. Who could ask of Perfection that He be
	imperfect?
	P 4 <em>a</em> 2. Who, then, decides what each brother needs? Surely not
	you, who do not yet recognise who he is who asks. There is
	Something in him that will tell you, if you listen. And that is the
	answer; listen. Do not demand, do not decide, do not sacrifice.
	Listen. What you hear is true. Would God send His Son to you and
	not be sure you recognise his needs? Think what God is telling you;
	He needs your voice to speak for Him. Could anything be holier?
	Or a greater gift to you? Would you rather choose who would be
	god, or hear the Voice of Him Who is God in you?
	P 4 <em>a</em> 3. Your patients need not be physically present for you to
	serve
	them in the Name of God. This may be hard to remember, but God
	will not have His gifts to you limited to the few you actually see.
	You can see others as well, for61 seeing is not limited to the bodyʹs
	eyes. Some do not need your physical presence. They need you as
	much, and perhaps even more, at the instant they are sent. You will
	recognise them in whatever way can be most helpful to both of you.
	It does not matter how they come. They will be sent in whatever
	form is most helpful; a name, a thought, a picture, an idea, or

	perhaps just a feeling of reaching out to someone somewhere. The
	joining is in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It cannot fail to be
	accomplished. P(20)
	P 4 <em>a</em> 4. A holy therapist, an advanced Teacher of God, never forgets
	one thing; he did not make the curriculum of salvation, nor did he
	establish his part in it. He understands that his part is necessary to
	the whole, and that through it he will recognise the whole when his
	part is complete. Meanwhile he must learn, and his patients are the
	means sent to him for his learning. What could he be but grateful
	for them and to them? They come bearing God. Would he refuse
	this Gift for a pebble, or would he close the door on the savior of the
	world to let in a ghost? Let him not betray the Son of God. Who
	calls on him is far beyond his understanding. Yet would he not
	rejoice that he can answer, when only thus will he be able to hear
	the call and understand that it is his? P(21)
	B. Is Psychotherapy a Profession?
	P 4 B 1. Strictly speaking the answer is no. How could a separate
	profession be one in which everyone is engaged? And how could
	any limits be laid on an62 interaction in which everyone is both
	patient and therapist in every relationship into63 which he enters?
	Yet practically speaking, it can still be said that there are those who
	devote themselves primarily to healing of one sort or another as
	their chief function. And it is to them that a large number of others64
	turn for help. That, in effect, is the practice of therapy. These65 are
	therefore ʺofficiallyʺ helpers. They are devoted to certain kinds of
	needs in their professional activities, although they may be far more
	able teachers outside of them. These people need no special rules, of

	course, but they may be called upon to use66 special applications of
	the general principles of healing.
	P 4 B 2. First, the professional therapist is in an excellent position to
	demonstrate that there is no order of difficulty in healing. For this,
	however, he needs special training, because the curriculum by
	which he became a therapist probably taught him little or nothing
	about the real principles of healing. In fact, it probably tried to
	teach67 him how to make healing impossible. Most of the worldʹs
	training follows68 a curriculum in judgement, with the aim of making
	the therapist a judge.
	P 4 B 3. Even this the Holy Spirit can use, and will use, given the
	slightest invitation. The unhealed healer may be arrogant, selfish,
	unconcerned, and actually dishonest. He may be disinterested and
	unconcerned with69 healing as his major goal. Yet something
	happened to him, however slight it may have been, when he chose
	to be a healer, however misguided the direction he may have
	chosen. That ʺsomethingʺ is enough. Sooner or later that something
	will rise in awareness70 and grow; a patient will touch his heart, and
	the therapist71 will silently ask him for help. He has himself found a
	therapist. He has asked the Holy Spirit to enter the relationship and
	heal it. He has accepted the Atonement for himself. P(22)
	P 4 B 4. God is said to have looked on all He created and pronounced
	it good.72 No, He declared it perfect, and so it was. And since His
	66 Originally typed “give,” Urtext manuscript mark-up suggests “offer” and
	finally “use” as seen here.
	The Notes has “use.”
	67 Handwritten mark-up and FIP have “taught” instead of “tried to teach.” The
	Notes has “tried to
	teach.”
	68 Handwritten mark-up and FIP replace “training programs follow” with
	“training follows” which
	would more closely resemble the Notes which has “training follow” which has an
	obvious grammar
	problem. It would need to be “training follows” which is what the mark-up
	indicates.
	69 Handwritten mark-up and FIP have “may be uninterested in.” The Notes has
	“may really be act
	unconcerned with healing as his major goal.” The word really is written
	between the lines and appears
	to be an afterthought. The word “act” is crossed out.
	70 Handwritten mark-up crosses out “in awareness.” FIP omits it. The Notes
	reads “sooner or later that
	it will rise and grow; a patient will …”
	71 Urtext manuscript has “he,” handwritten mark-up and FIP substitute
	“therapist.” In the Notes it is
	“he.”

	creations do not change and last forever, so it is now. Yet neither a
	perfect therapist nor a perfect patient can possibly exist. Both must
	have denied their perfection, for their very need for each other
	implies a sense of lack. A one‐to‐one relationship is not one
	Relationship. Yet it is the means of return; the way God chose for
	the return of His Son. In that strange dream a strange correction
	must enter, for only that is the call to awake. And what else should
	therapy be? Awake and be glad, for all your sins have been
	forgiven you. This is the only message that any two should ever
	give each other.
	P 4 B 5. Something good must come from every meeting of patient
	and therapist. And that good is saved for both, against the day
	when they can recognise that only that was real in their relationship.
	At that moment it is73 returned to them, blessed by the Holy Spirit as
	a gift from their Creator as a sign of His Love. For the therapeutic
	relationship must become like the relationship of the Father and the
	Son. There is no other, for there is nothing else. The therapists of
	this world do not expect this outcome, and many of their patients
	would not74 be able to accept help from them if they did. Yet no
	therapist really sets the goal for the relationships of which he is a
	part. His understanding begins with recognising this, and then goes
	on from there.
	P 4 B 6. It is in the instant that the therapist forgets to judge the
	patient that healing occurs. In some relationships this point is never
	reached, although both patient and therapist may arrive at
	different75 dreams in the process. Yet it will not be the same dream
	for both of them, and so it is not the dream of forgiveness in which
	both will someday wake. The good is saved; indeed is cherished.
	73 Urtext manuscript has “it is” which is the same as the Notes. “The good” is
	handwritten in between
	the lines. FIP preserves that editing change.
	74 The word “not” is handwritten, it is not in the original Urtext manuscript.
	It is, however, present in
	the Notes.
	75 The Urtext manuscript has “may arrive at different dreams…” Handwritten
	mark-up and FIP replace
	that with “may change their dreams.” The Notes has “may arrive at a different
	dream in the process.”
	Also, the Notes appears to have initially said “the patient may arrive at a
	different dream in the process”
	with strikeout and interlinear writing changing that to “both patient and
	therapist may arrive at a
	different dream in the process.”

	But only little time is saved and76 the new dreams will lose their
	temporary appeal and turn to dreams of fear, which is the content of
	all dreams. Yet no patient can accept more than he is ready to
	receive, and no therapist can offer more than he believes he has.
	And so there is a place for all relationships in this world, and they
	will bring as much good as each can accept and use. P(23)
	P 4 B 7. Yet it is when judgement ceases that healing occurs, because
	only then it can be understood that there is no order of difficulty in
	healing. This is a necessary understanding for the healed healer.
	He has learned that it is no harder to wake a brother from one
	dream than from another. No professional therapist can hold this
	understanding consistently in his mind, offering it to all who come
	to him. There are some in this world who have come very close, but
	they have not accepted the gift entirely in order to stay and let their
	understanding remain on earth until the closing of time. They could
	hardly be called professional therapists. They are the Saints of God.
	They are the Saviours of the world. Their image remains, because
	they have chosen that it be so. They take the place of other images,
	and help with kindly dreams.
	P 4 B 8. Once the professional therapist has realised that minds are
	joined, he can also recognise that order of difficulty in healing is
	meaningless. Yet well before he reaches this in time he can go
	toward it. Many holy instants can be his along the way. A goal
	marks the end of a journey, not the beginning, and as each goal is
	reached another can be dimly seen ahead. Most professional
	therapists are still at the very start of the beginning stage of the first
	journey. Even those who have begun to understand what they must
	do may still oppose the setting‐out. Yet all the laws of healing can
	be theirs in just an instant. The journey is not long except in dreams.

	P 4 B 9. The professional therapist has one advantage that can save
	enormous time if it is properly used. He has chosen a road on77
	which there is great temptation to misuse his role. This enables him
	to pass by many obstacles to peace quite quickly, if he escapes the
	temptation to assume a function that has not been given him. To
	understand there is no order of difficulty in healing, he must also
	recognise the equality of himself and the patient. There is no
	halfway point in this. Either they are equal or not. The attempts of
	therapists to compromise in this respect are strange indeed. Some
	utilise the relationship merely to collect bodies to worship at their
	shrine, and this they regard as healing. P(24) Many patients, too,
	consider this strange procedure as salvation. Yet at each meeting
	there is One Who says, ʺMy brother, choose again.ʺ
	P 4 B 10. Do not forget that any form of specialness must be
	defended, and will be. The defenseless therapist has the strength of
	God with him, but the defensive therapist has lost sight of the
	Source of his salvation. He does not see and he does not hear. How,
	then, can he teach? Because it is the Will of God that he take his
	place in the plan for salvation. Because it is the Will of God that his
	patients be helped to join with him there. Because his inability to
	see and hear does not limit the Holy Spirit in any way. Except in
	time. In time there can be a great lag between the offering and the
	acceptance of healing. This is the veil across the Face of Christ. Yet
	it can be but an illusion, because time does not exist and the Will of
	God has always been exactly as it is. P(25)
	C. The Question of Payment
	P 4 C 1. No‐one can pay for therapy, for healing is of God and He
	asks for nothing. It is, however, part of His plan that everything in
	this world be used by the Holy Spirit to help in carrying out the
	plan. Even an advanced therapist has some earthly needs while he
	is here. Should he need money it will be given him, not in payment,
	77 Urtext manuscript has “chosen a role on which.” handwritten mark-up changes
	that to “chosen a road
	on which,” and then changes it again, with FIP to “chosen a road in which.”
	Temptations aren’t “in”
	roads, but rather are “on” them, so we’re going with the second option. The
	Notes has “road on which.”
	PROOF COPY 1785
	Volume V Psychotherapy
	V‐28
	but to help him better serve the plan. Money is not evil. It is
	nothing. But no‐one here can live with no illusions, for he must yet
	strive to have the last illusion be accepted by everyone everywhere.
	He has a mighty part in this one purpose, for which he came. He
	stays here but for this. And while he stays he will be given what he
	needs to stay.
	P 4 C 2. Only an unhealed healer could78 try to heal for money, and
	he will not succeed to the extent to which he values it. Nor will he
	find his healing in the process. There will be those of whom the
	Holy Spirit asks some payment for His purpose. There will be those
	from whom He does not ask. It should not be the therapist who
	makes these decisions. There is a difference between payment and
	cost. To give money where Godʹs plan allots it has no cost. To
	withhold it from where it rightfully belongs has enormous cost. The
	therapist who would do this loses the name of healer, for he could
	never understand what healing is. He cannot give it, and so he does
	not have it.
	P 4 C 3. The therapists of this world are indeed useless to the worldʹs
	salvation. They make demands, and so they cannot give. Patients
	can pay only for the exchange of illusions. This, indeed, must
	demand payment, and the cost is great. A ʺboughtʺ relationship
	cannot offer the only gift whereby all healing is accomplished.
	Forgiveness, the Holy Spiritʹs only dream, must have no cost. For if
	it does, it merely crucifies Godʹs Son again. Can this be how he is
	forgiven? Can this be how the dream of sin will end?
	P 4 C 4. The “right to live”79 is something no‐one need fight for. It is
	promised him, and guaranteed by God. Therefore it is a right the
	therapist and patient share alike. P(26) If their relationship is to be
	holy, whatever one needs is given by the other; whatever one lacks
	the other supplies. Herein is the relationship made holy, for herein
	both are healed. The therapist repays the patient in gratitude, as
	does the patient repay him. There is no cost to either. But thanks

	are due to both, for the release from long imprisonment and doubt.
	Who would not be grateful for such a gift? Yet who could possibly
	imagine that it could be bought?
	P 4 C 5. It has well been80 said that to him who hath shall be given.81
	Because he has, he can give. And because he gives, he shall be
	given. This is the law of God, and not of the world. So it is with
	Godʹs healers. They give because they have heard His Word and
	understood
	it. All that they need will thus be given them. But they will lose this
	understanding unless they remember that all they have comes only
	from God. If they believe they need anything from a brother, they
	will recognise him as a brother no longer. And if they do this, a
	light goes out even in Heaven. Where Godʹs Son turns against
	himself, he can look only upon darkness. He has himself denied the
	light, and cannot see.
	P 4 C 6. One rule should always be observed: No‐one should be
	turned away because he cannot pay. No‐one is sent by accident to
	anyone. Relationships are always purposeful. Whatever their
	purpose may have been before the Holy Spirit entered them, they
	are always His potential temple82; the resting place of Christ and
	home of God Himself. Whoever comes has been sent. Perhaps he
	was sent to give his brother the money he needed. Both will be
	blessed thereby. Perhaps he was sent to teach the therapist how
	much he needs forgiveness, and how valueless is money in
	comparison. Again will both be blessed. Only in terms of cost

	P 4 C 7. This view of payment may well seem impractical, and in the
	eyes of the world it would be so. Yet not one worldly thought is
	really practical. How much is gained by striving for illusions? How
	much is lost by throwing God away? And is it possible to do so?
	Surely it is impractical to strive for nothing, and to attempt to do
	what is impossible. Then stop a while, long enough to think of this:
	P(27) You have perhaps been seeking for salvation without
	recognising where to look. Whoever asks your help can show you
	where. What greater gift than this could you be given? What
	greater gift is there that you would give?
	P 4 C 8. Physician, healer, therapist, teacher, heal thyself.83 Many will
	come to you carrying the gift of healing, if you so elect. The Holy
	Spirit never refuses an invitation to enter and abide with you. He
	will give you endless opportunities to open the door to your
	salvation, for such is His function. He will also tell you exactly what
	your function is in every circumstance and at all times. Whoever He
	sends you will reach you, holding out his hand to his Friend. Let
	the Christ in you bid him welcome, for that same Christ is in him as
	well. Deny him entrance, and you have denied the Christ in you.
	Remember the sorrowful story of the world, and the glad tidings84
	of salvation. Remember the plan of God for the restoration of joy
	and peace. And do not forget how very simple are the ways of God:
	You were lost in the darkness of the world until you asked for light.
	And then God sent His Son to give it to you.85

	in the presence of
	God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings.”

	PRAYER
	<em>a</em>. Introduction:
	S 1 <em>a</em> 1 Prayer is the greatest gift with which God blessed His Son
	at his creation. It was then what it is to become; the single Voice
	Creator and creation share; the song the Son sings to the Father,
	Who returns the thanks it offers Him unto the Son. Endless the
	harmony, and endless too the joyous concord of the Love They1 give
	forever to each other. And in this creation is extended. God gives
	thanks to His extension in His Son. His Son gives thanks for his
	creation, in the song of his creating in his Fatherʹs Name. The Love
	They share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time
	is done. For such it was before time seemed to be.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 2 To you who are in time a little while, prayer takes the form
	that best will suit your need. You have but one. What God created
	one must recognise its oneness, and rejoice that what illusions
	seemed to separate is one forever in the Mind of God. Prayer now
	must be the means by which Godʹs Son leaves separate goals and
	separate interests by, and turns in holy gladness to the truth of
	union in his Father and himself.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 3 Lay down your dreams, you holy Son of God, and rising up
	as God created you, dispense with idols and remember Him. Prayer
	will sustain you now, and bless you as you lift your hearts2 to Him
	in rising song that reaches higher and then higher still until both
	high and low have disappeared. Faith in your goal will grow and
	hold you up as you ascend the shining stairway to the lawns of
	Heaven and the gate of peace. For this is prayer, and here salvation
	is. This is the way. It is Godʹs gift to you.3 S(2)

	S 1 <em>a</em> 4 Asking is holy, and it is holy because it is a way of
	reaching
	God. He is the Answerer because you are in need of an Answer.
	No‐one can4 ask for another and receive the Answer for him. But
	you can, and indeed you must, help him by offering your love and
	support that his answer5 be holy and his true need recognised. That
	is prayer; it is the same for yourself or for another. There is no
	difference. If you received the answers for another, there would be a
	difference.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 5 This does not mean that you cannot get messages for
	another, if it is God Who chooses this way of reaching him. This
	will usually happen unexpectedly, generally in the form of a sudden
	feeling that you have something to tell him; a message to deliver.
	You have not been wrong in the past about how you have asked,
	but you are ready for a step ahead now. There are joint decisions in
	which unanimity of response is a good indication of authenticity.
	This should not be abandoned. But asking is a lesson in trust, and
	no‐one can trust for another. He can only strengthen another’s trust
	by offering it to him and having faith in his ability to hear for
	himself.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 6 Asking is the way to God because it offers us6 His Will as
	He would have us7 hear it. We will have a series of lessons on
	asking because you have not understood it. But do not think
	because of that that you have been mistaken in your attempts. You
	have done well and will do better. S(3)
	S 1 <em>a</em> 7 Any specific question involves a large number of
	assumptions which inevitably limit the answer. A specific question
	is actually a decision about the kind of answer that is8 acceptable.

	footnotes variant readings from an undetermined source. Unfortunately I have
	been unable to identify
	precisely what Smith’s source was but I suspect it is another and different
	typed scribal manuscript,
	giving these footnotes some genuine authority. This is a matter which will
	have to be clarified with

	The purpose of words is to limit, and by limiting to make a vast area
	of experience9 more manageable. But that means manageable by
	YOU. For many aspects of living in this world that is necessary. But
	not for asking. God does not use words and does not answer in
	words. He can only “speak”10 to the Christ in you, Who translates
	His Answer11 into whatever language you can understand and
	accept. Sometimes words will limit fear; sometimes not. That is
	why some people hear words, some12 receive feelings of inner
	conviction, and some do not become aware of anything. Yet God
	has answered, and His Answer will reach you when you are ready.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 8 Answers are not up to you. Any limit you place on13 them
	interferes with hearing. God’s Voice is silent and speaks in silence.14
	That means that you do not phrase the question and you do not
	restrict the answer.
	S 1 <em>a</em> 9 Asking is15 prayer. It is not a demand. It is not
	questioning.
	It is not limitation. The only real request is for God’s Answer. It16
	needs the humility of trust, not the arrogance of false certainty.
	Trust cannot lie in idols, for that is merely faith in magic.17 Trust
	requires faith that God understands, knows, and will answer. It
	means a state of peace. For this you can18 safely ask. In fact, if you
	do not feel that you19 have it, asking for it is the only real request20
	you can make.

	B. True Prayer
	S 1 B 1 Prayer is a21 way offered by the Holy Spirit to reach God. It
	is not merely a question or an entreaty. It cannot succeed until you
	realise that it asks for nothing. How else could it serve its purpose?
	It is impossible to pray for idols and hope to reach God. True
	prayer must avoid the pitfall of asking to entreat. Ask rather to
	receive what is already given;22 to accept what is already there.
	S 1 B 2 You have been told to ask the Holy Spirit for the answer to
	any specific S(4) problem, and that you will receive a specific
	answer if such is your need. You have also been told that there is
	only one problem and one answer. In prayer this is not
	contradictory. There are decisions to make here, and they must be
	made whether they be illusions or not. You cannot be asked to
	accept answers which are beyond the level of need that23 you24
	recognise.25 Therefore it is not the form of the question that matters,
	nor how it is asked. The form of the answer, if given by God
	through His Voice,26 will suit your need as you see it. This is merely
	an echo of the reply of His Voice. The real sound is always a song of
	thanksgiving and love.27
	S 1 B 3 We28 cannot, then, ask for the echo. It is the song that is the
	gift. Along with it come the overtones, the harmonics, the echoes,
	but these are secondary. In true prayer you hear only the song. All
	the rest is merely added. You have sought first the Kingdom of
	Heaven,29 and all else has indeed been given you.30
	21 Manuscript does not have the “a” here, it is a handwritten correction
	22 Matthew 7:7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be opened
	to you.”

	24 FIP inserts “can” here
	25 Handwritten mark-up indicates paragraph break at this point.
	26Handwritten mark-up crosses out “through His Voice”
	27 FIP has “of Love”
	28 “We” is crossed out and “You” is penciled in.
	29 Handwritten mark-up appears to cross out the comma.

	all these things shall be
	added to you.”
	PROOF COPY 1796
	Volume VI Song of Prayer
	VI‐5
	S 1 B 4 The secret of true prayer is to forget the things you think
	you need. To ask for the specific is much the same as to look on sin
	and then forgive it. Also in the same way, in prayer you overlook
	your specific needs as you see them, and let them go into His31
	hands. There they become your gifts to Him, for they tell Him that
	you would have no gods before Him;32 no Love33 but His.34 What
	could His Answer be but your remembrance of Him? Can this be
	traded for a bit of trifling advice about a problem of an instantʹs
	duration? God answers only for eternity. But still all little answers
	are contained in this.
	S 1 B 5 Prayer is a stepping aside; a letting go; a quiet time of
	listening and loving. It should not be confused with supplication of
	any kind, because it is a way of remembering your holiness. Why
	should holiness entreat, being fully entitled to everything love has
	to offer? And it is to Love one goes35 in prayer. Prayer is an
	offering; a giving up of oneself36 to be at one with Love. There is
	nothing to ask because there is nothing left to want. That
	nothingness becomes the altar of God. It disappears in Him. S(5)
	S 1 B 6 This is not a level of prayer that everyone can attain as yet.
	Those who have not37 need your help in prayer because their asking
	is not yet based upon acceptance. Help in prayer does not mean
	that another mediates between you and God. But it does mean that
	another can stand38 beside you and help39 to raise you up to Him.
	One who has realised the goodness of God prays without fear. And
	one who prays without fear cannot but reach Him. He can therefore
	also reach His Son, wherever he may be and whatever form he may
	seem to take.
	31 Handwritten mark-up and FIP change this to “God’s”
	32 Exodus 20:3 “You shall have no other gods before Me.”
	33 Manuscript is in lower case, handwritten mark-up corrects it to upper case.
	34 The word (Him) is typed in brackets and crossed out.
	35 Handwritten mark-up and FIP suggest “you go”
	36 Crossed out with “yourself” penciled in.
	37 FIP adds “reached it still”, handwritten mark-up adds “still.” the original
	typing is crossed out and
	reads “Until they (He) do they …”
	38 Handwritten mark-up crosses out “can” and pluralizes “stand” to “stands”
	39 Handwritten mark-up and FIP have this as “helps” instead of “help”

	VI‐6
	S 1 B 7 Praying to Christ in anyone is true prayer because it is a gift
	of thanks to his Father. To ask that Christ be but Himself is not an
	entreaty but it IS40 a song of thanksgiving for what you are. Herein
	lies the power of prayer. It asks nothing and receives everything.
	This prayer can be shared because it receives for everyone. To pray
	with one who knows that this is true is to be answered. Perhaps the
	specific form of solution41 for a specific problem will occur to either
	of you; it does not matter which. Perhaps it will reach both, if you
	are genuinely attuned to one another. It will come because you
	have realised that it does not matter. Therein lies its only truth.42
	C. The Ladder of Prayer
	S 1 C 1 Prayer has no beginning and no end. It is a part of life. But
	it does change in form, and grows with learning until it reaches its
	formless state, and fuses into total communication with God. In its
	asking form it need not, and often does not, make appeal to God, or
	even involve belief in Him. At that level43 prayer is merely wanting,
	out of a sense of scarcity and lack.
	S 1 C 2 The prayer, or asking‐out‐of‐need,44 always involves
	feelings of weakness and inadequacy, and could never be made by a
	Son of God who knows Who he is. No‐one, then, who is sure of his
	Identity could pray in this form.45 Yet it is also true that no‐one who
	is uncertain of his Identity could46 avoid praying in this way. And
	prayer is as continual as life. Everyone prays without ceasing.47
	40 Handwritten mark-up crosses out “but it is” , FIP inserts sentence break
	after “entreaty” and leaves
	out “but” and the handwritten mark-up may do that also, legibility is not
	good.
	41 FIP changes “solution” to “resolution”
	42 Handwritten mark-up suggests “Christ is in both of you. That is its only
	truth.”
	43 Handwritten mark-up suggests “these levels”
	44 Handwritten mark-up replaces “for” with “or”. FIP rewrites this as “These
	forms of prayer, or
	asking… involve” Some think it was supposed to be “That prayer, or asking out
	of need, always
	involves” as this requires the fewest alterations of the text to achieve
	grammatical and logical sense.
	Manuscript has “The prayer for asking-out-of-need”
	45 FIP changes “this form” to “these forms”
	46 Handwritten mark-up suggests “can”
	47 1 Thessalonians 5:17 “Pray without ceasing,”
	PROOF COPY 1798
	Volume VI Song of Prayer
	VI‐7
	Ask and you have received,48 for you have established what it is S(6)
	you want.
	S 1 C 3 It is also possible to reach a higher form of asking‐out‐ofneed,
	for in this world prayer must be used for reparation,49 and so
	it must entail levels of learning. Here, the asking may be addressed
	to God in honest belief, though not yet with understanding. A
	vague and usually unstable sense of identification has generally
	been reached, but it50 tends to be blurred by a deep‐rooted sense of
	sin. It is possible at this level to continue to ask for things of this
	world in various forms, but51 it is also possible to ask for qualities52
	such as honesty or goodness, and particularly for forgiveness for the
	many sources of guilt that inevitably underlie any prayer of need.
	Without guilt there is no scarcity. The sinless have no needs.
	S 1 C 4 At this level also comes53 that curious contradiction in terms
	known as “praying for oneʹs enemies.” The contradiction lies not in
	the actual words, but54 in the way they are usually interpreted.
	While you believe you have enemies, you have limited prayer to the
	laws of this world, and55 limited your ability to receive and56 accept
	to the same narrow margins. And yet, if you have enemies you
	have need of prayer, and great need, too. What does the phrase
	really mean? Pray for yourself, that you may not seek to imprison
	Christ and thereby lose the recognition of your own Identity. Be
	traitor to no‐one, or you will be treacherous to yourself. An enemy
	is the symbol for57 an imprisoned Christ. And who could He be
	except yourself?
	48 Matthew. 7:7-8 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
	knock, and it will be
	opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to
	him who knocks it will
	be opened.” Also see Luke. 11:19;John 17:7;16:23

	S 1 C 5 The prayer for enemies thus becomes a prayer for your own
	freedom. Now it is no longer a contradiction in terms. Rather it is58
	a statement of the unity of Christ and a recognition of His
	sinlessness. And now it has become holy, for it acknowledges the
	Son of God as he was created.
	S 1 C 6 Let it never be forgotten that prayer at any level is always
	for yourself. If you unite with anyone in prayer, you make him part
	of you. The enemy59 is you, as is the Christ. Before it can become
	holy, then, prayer becomes a choice. You do not choose for another.
	You can but choose for yourself. Pray truly for your enemies, S(7)
	then, for herein lies your own salvation. Forgive them for your sins,
	and you will be forgiven indeed.
	S 1 C 7 Prayer is a ladder reaching up to Heaven.60 At the top there
	is a transformation much like your own, for prayer is part of you.
	The things of earth are left behind, all unremembered. There is no
	asking, for there is no lack. Identity in Christ is fully recognised as
	set forever, beyond all change and incorruptible. The light no
	longer flickers, and will never go out.
	S 1 C 8 Now, without needs of any kind, and clad forever in the
	pure sinlessness which61 is the gift of God to you, His Son, prayer
	can again become what it was meant to be. For now it rises as a
	song of thanks to your Creator, sung without words, or thoughts, or
	vain desires, unneedful now of anything at all. So it extends, as it
	was meant to do. And for this giving God Himself gives thanks.
	S 1 C 9 God is the goal of every prayer, giving it timelessness
	instead of end. Nor has it a62 beginning, because the goal has never
	changed. Prayer in its earlier forms is an illusion, because there is
	no need for a ladder to reach what one has never left. Yet prayer is
	part of forgiveness as long as forgiveness, itself an illusion, remains
	58 Handwritten mark-up crosses out “Rather” and changes “it is” to “It has
	become”.

	the top of it reached to
	heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. “

	unattained. Prayer is tied up with learning until the goal of learning
	has been reached. And then all things will be transformed together,
	and returned unblemished into the Mind of God.
	S 1 C 10 Being beyond learning, this state cannot be described. The
	stages necessary to its attainment, however, need to be understood,
	if peace is to be restored to the Son of God,63 who lives now with the
	illusion of death and the fear of God.
	D. Praying for Others
	S 1 D 1 We said that prayer is always for yourself, and this is true.64
	Why, then, should you pray for others at all? And if you should,
	how should you do it? Praying for others, if rightly understood,
	becomes a means for lifting your projections of guilt from your
	brother, and enabling you to recognise it is not he who is hurting
	you. The poisonous thought that he <em>is</em> your enemy, your evil
	counterpart, your nemesis, must be relinquished before YOU can be
	saved from guilt. For this the means is prayer, of rising power and
	with ascending S(8) goals, until it reaches even up to God.
	S 1 D 2 The earlier forms of prayer, at the bottom of the ladder, will
	not be free from envy and even65 malice. They call for vengeance,
	not for love. Nor do they come from one who understands that they
	are calls for death, made out of fear by those who cherish guilt.
	They call upon a vengeful god, and it is he who seems to answer
	them. Hell cannot be asked for another, and then escaped by him
	who asks for this.66 Only those who are in hell can ask for hell.
	Those who have been forgiven, and who have67 accepted their
	forgiveness, could never make a prayer like this.68
	S 1 D 3 At this level,69 then, the learning goal must be to recognise
	that prayer will bring an answer only in the form in which the

	“What I have asked for for my brother is not what I would have. Thus
	have I made of him my enemy.”72
	S 1 D 4 It is apparent that this step cannot be reached by anyone
	who sees no value nor73 advantage to himself in setting others free.
	This may be long delayed, because this step74 may seem to be
	dangerous instead of merciful. To the guilty there seems indeed to
	be a real advantage in having enemies, and this imagined gain75
	must go, if enemies are to be set free. Guilt must be given up, and
	not concealed. Nor can it be76 without some pain, and a glimpse of
	the merciful nature of this step may for some time be followed by a
	deep retreat into fear. For fearʹs defences are fearful in themselves,
	and when they are recognised they bring their fear with them.
	S 1 D 5 Yet what advantage has an illusion of escape ever brought a
	prisoner? His real escape from guilt can lie only in the recognition
	that the guilt has gone. And how can this be recognised as long as
	he hides it in another, and does not see it as his own? Fear of escape
	makes it difficult to welcome freedom, and to make a jailer of an
	enemy seems to be safety. How, then, can he be released without an
	insane fear for yourself? You have made of him your salvation and
	your S(9) escape from guilt. Your investment in this escape is
	heavy, and your fear of letting77 go is strong.
	S 1 D 6 Stand still an instant, now, and think what you have done.
	Do not forget that it is you who did it, and who can therefore let it
	go. Hold out your hand; this enemy has come to bless you. Take
	his blessing and feel how your heart is lifted and your fear released.
	Do not hold on to it, nor onto him. He is a Son of God, along with

	you. He is no jailer, but a messenger of Christ. Be this to him, that
	you may see him thus.
	S 1 D 7 It is not easy to realise that prayers for things, for status,78
	for external ʺgiftsʺ of any kind, are always made to set up jailers79
	and to hide from guilt. Yet these things, too,80 are used for goals
	that substitute for God, and therefore distort the purpose of prayer.
	The desire for them <em>is</em> the prayer. One need not ask explicitly. The
	goal of God is lost in the quest for lesser goals of any kind, and
	prayer becomes requests for enemies. The power of prayer can be
	quite clearly recognised even in this. No‐one who wants an enemy
	will fail to find one. But just as surely will he lose the only true goal
	that is given him. Think of the cost, and understand it well. All
	other goals are at the cost of God.
	E. Praying with Others
	S 1 E 1 Until the second step81 at least begins, one cannot share in
	prayer,82 for until that point, each one must ask for different things.
	But once the need to hold the other as an enemy has been
	questioned, and the reason83 has been recognised if only for an
	instant, it becomes84 possible to join in prayer. Enemies do not share
	a goal, and it is here85 their enmity is kept. Their separate wishes are
	their arsenals; their fortresses in hate. The key to rising further still
	in prayer lies in this simple thought; this change of mind:
	We go together, you and I.
	S 1 E 2 Now it is possible to help in prayer, and so reach up
	yourself. This step begins the quicker ascent, but there are still
	many lessons86 to learn. The way is open, and hope is justified. Yet

	it is likely at first that what is asked for even by those who join87 in
	prayer is not the goal that prayer S(10) should truly seek. Even
	together they88 may ask for things, and thus set up but an illusion of
	a goal they89 share. They90 may ask together for specifics, and not
	realise that they91 are asking for effects without the cause. And this
	they92 cannot have. For no‐one can receive effects alone, and
	choose93 a cause from which they do not come to offer them to him.
	Even the joining, then, is not enough, if those who pray together do
	not ask, before all else, what is the Will of God. From this Cause
	only can the Answer94 come in which are all specifics satisfied; all
	separate wishes unified in one.
	S 1 E 3 Prayers95 for specifics always ask96 to have the past repeated
	in some way. What was enjoyed before, or seemed to be, ‐‐ what
	was97 anotherʹs and he seemed to like,98 ‐‐ all these are but illusions
	from the past. The aim of prayer is to release the present from its
	chains of past illusions; to let it be a freely chosen remedy from
	every choice that stood for a mistake. What prayer can offer now so
	far exceeds all that you asked before that it is pitiful to be content
	with less.
	S 1 E 4 You have99 a newborn‐chance each time you pray. And
	would you stifle and imprison it in ancient prisons, when the chance
	has come to free yourself from all of them at once? Do not restrict
	your asking. Prayer can bring the peace of God. What time‐bound
	thing can give you more than this, in just the little space that lasts
	until it crumbles into dust?

	F. The Ladder Ends
	S 1 F 1 Prayer is a way to true humility. But100 here again it rises101
	up, slowly at first,102 and grows in strength and love and holiness.
	Let it but leave the ground where it begins to rise to God, and true
	humility will come at last to grace the mind that thought it was
	alone and stood against the world. Humility brings peace because it
	does not claim that you must rule the universe, nor103 judge all
	things as you would have them be. All little gods it gladly lays
	aside, not in resentment, but in honesty and recognition that they
	did104 not serve.
	S 1 F 2 Illusions and humility have goals so far apart they cannot
	coëxist, S(11) nor share a dwelling place.105 Where one has come the
	other disappears. The truly humble have no goal but God because
	they need no idols, and defence no longer has106 a purpose. Enemies
	are useless now, because humility does not oppose. It does not hide
	in shame because it is content with what it is, knowing creation is
	the Will of God. Its selflessness is Self, and this it sees in every
	meeting, where it gladly joins with every Son of God, whose purity
	it recognises that it shares with him. Now prayer is lifted from the
	world of things, of bodies, and of gods of every kind, and you can
	rest in holiness at last. Humility has taught107 you how to
	understand your glory as Godʹs Son, and recognise the arrogance of
	sin. A dream has veiled the face of Christ from you. Now can you
	look upon His sinlessness.
	S 1 F 3 High has the ladder risen. You have come almost to
	Heaven. There is little more to learn before the journey is complete.

	And so he is in truth. Now must110 you pray only for what you truly
	share with him. For you have understood he never left, and you,
	who seemed alone, are one with him.
	S 1 F 4 The ladder ends with this, for learning is no longer needed.
	Now you stand before the gate of Heaven, and your brother stands
	beside you there. The lawns are deep and still, for here the place
	appointed for the time when you should come has waited long for
	you. Here will time end forever. At this gate eternity itself will join
	with you. Prayer has become what it was meant to be, for you have
	recognised the Christ in you. S(12)
	FORGIVENESS
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	S 2 <em>a</em> 1 Forgiveness offers wings to prayer, to make its rising easy
	and its progress swift. Without its strong support it would be vain
	to try to rise above the111 bottom step, or even to attempt to climb at
	all. Forgiveness is prayerʹs ally; sister in the plan for your salvation.
	Both must come to hold you up and keep your feet secure; your
	purpose steadfast and unchangeable. Behold the greatest help that
	God ordained to be with you until you reach to Him. Illusionʹs end
	will come with this. Unlike the timeless nature of its sister prayer,
	forgiveness has an end, for it becomes unneeded when the rising up
	is done. Yet now it has a purpose beyond which you cannot go, nor
	have you need to go. Accomplish this and you have been
	redeemed. Accomplish this and you have been transformed.
	Accomplish this and you will save the world.
	B. Forgiveness of Yourself
	S 2 B 1 No gift of Heaven has been more misunderstood than has
	forgiveness. It has, in fact, become a scourge; a curse where it was
	meant to bless, a cruel mockery of grace, a parody upon the holy
	110 Handwritten mark-up, FIP suggest “can” instead of “must”
	111 FIP replaces “the” with “Prayer’s”

	VI‐15
	peace of God. Yet those who have not yet elected112 to begin the
	steps of prayer cannot but use it thus. Forgivenessʹs113 kindness is
	obscure at first, because salvation is not understood, <em>nor</em> TRULY
	<em>sought</em> FOR. What was meant to heal is used to hurt because
	forgiveness is not wanted. Guilt becomes salvation, and the remedy
	appears to be a terrible alternative to life.
	S 2 B 2 Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will therefore suit the purpose of the
	world far better than its true objective, and the honest means by
	which this goal is reached. Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will overlook no
	sin, no crime, no guilt that it can114 find and “love.” Dear to its heart
	is error, and mistakes loom large and grow and swell within its
	sight. It carefully picks out all evil things, and overlooks the loving
	as a plague; a hateful thing of danger and of death. Forgiveness‐todestroy
	<em>is</em> death,115 and this it sees in everything116S(13) it looks
	upon and hates. Godʹs mercy has become a twisted knife that
	would destroy the holy Son He loves.
	S 2 B 3 Would you forgive yourself for doing this? Then learn that
	God has given you a117 means by which you can return to Him in
	peace. DO <em>not see</em> ERROR. Do not make it real. Select the loving
	and forgive the sin by choosing in its place the face of Christ. How
	otherwise can prayer return to God? He loves His Son. Can you
	remember Him and hate what He created? You will hate his Father
	if you hate the Son He loves. For as you see the Son you see
	yourself, and as you see yourself is God to you.118
	S 2 B 4 As prayer is always for yourself, so is forgiveness119 given
	you. It is impossible to forgive another, for it is only your sins you

	see in him. You want to see them there, and not in you. That is why
	forgiveness of another is an illusion. Yet it is the only happy dream
	in all the world; the only one that does not lead to death. Only in
	someone else can you forgive yourself, for you have called him
	guilty of your sins, and in him must your innocence120 be found.
	Who but the sinful need to be forgiven? And do not ever think you
	can see sin in anyone except yourself.
	S 2 B 5 This is the great deception of the world, and you the great
	deceiver of yourself. It always seems to be another who is evil, and
	in his sin you are the injured one. How could freedom be possible if
	this were true?121 You would be slave to everyone, for what he does
	entails your fate, your feelings, your despair or hope, your misery or
	joy. You have no freedom unless he gives it to you. And being evil,
	he can only give of what he is. You cannot see his sins and not your
	own. But you can free him and yourself as well.
	S 2 B 6 Forgiveness, truly given, is the only way in which your122
	hope of freedom lies. Others will make mistakes and so will you, as
	long as this illusion of a world appears to be your home. God123 has
	given all His Sons a remedy for all illusions that they think they see.
	Christʹs vision does not use your eyes, but you can look through His
	and learn to see like Him. Mistakes are tiny shadows, quickly gone,
	which124 for an instant only seem S(14) to hide the face of Christ,
	which still remains unchanged behind them all. His constancy
	remains in tranquil silence and in perfect peace. He does not know
	of shadows. His the eyes that look past error to the Christ in you.
	S 2 B 7 Ask then His help, and ask Him how to learn forgiveness as
	His vision lets it be. You are in need of what He gives, and your
	salvation rests on learning this of Him. Prayer cannot be released to
	Heaven while forgiveness‐to‐destroy remains with you. Godʹs

	mercy would remove this withering and poisoned thinking from
	your holy mind. Christ has forgiven you, and in His sight the world
	is125 holy as Himself. Who sees no evil in it sees like Him, for what
	He has forgiven has not sinned, and guilt can be no more.
	Salvationʹs plan is made complete, and sanity has come.
	S 2 B 8 Forgiveness is the call to sanity, for who but the insane
	would look on sin when he could see the face of Christ instead?
	This is the choice you make; the simplest one, and yet the only one
	that you can make. God calls on you to save His Son from death by
	offering the love of Christ126 to him. This is your need, and God
	Himself127 holds out this gift to you. As He would give, so must you
	give as well. And thus is prayer restored to formlessness, beyond
	all limits into timelessness, with nothing of the past to hold it back
	from re‐uniting with the ceaseless song that all creation sings unto
	its God. S(15)
	S 2 B 9 But to achieve this end you first must learn, before you
	reach where learning cannot go. Forgiveness is the key, but who
	can use a key when he has lost the door for which the key was
	made, and where alone it fits? Therefore we make distinctions, so
	that prayer can be released from darkness into light.
	Forgivenessʹs128 role must be reversed, and cleansed from evil
	usages and hateful goals. Forgiveness‐to‐destroy must be unveiled
	in all its treachery, and then let go forever and forever. There can be
	no trace of it remaining, if the plan that God established for
	returning be achieved at last, and learning be complete.
	S 2 B 10 This is the world of opposites. And you must choose
	between them every instant while this world retains reality for you.
	Yet you must learn alternatives for choice, or you will not be able to
	attain your freedom. Let it then be clear to you exactly what

	freedom to ascend above the world of chaos into peace.
	C. Forgiveness‐to‐destroy
	S 2 C 1 Forgiveness‐to‐destroy has many forms, being a weapon of
	the world of form. Not all of them are obvious, and some are
	carefully concealed beneath what seems like charity. Yet all the
	forms that it may130 take have but one131 goal; their purpose is to
	separate and make what God created equal, different. The
	difference is clear in several forms where the designed comparison
	cannot be missed, nor is it132 meant to be.
	S 2 C 2 In this group, first, there are the forms in which a ʺbetterʺ
	person deigns to stoop to save a baser133 one from what he134 is.
	Forgiveness here rests solely on the base135 of gracious lordliness so
	far from love that arrogance could never be dislodged. Who can
	forgive and yet despise? And who can tell another he is steeped in
	sin, and yet perceive him as the Son of God? Who makes a slave to
	teach what freedom is? There is no union here, but only grief. This
	is not136 mercy. This is death.
	S 2 C 3 Another form, still very like the first if it is understood, does
	not appear in quite such blatant arrogance. The one who would
	forgive the S(16) other does not claim to be the better. Now he
	merely137 says138 that here is one whose sinfulness he shares, since
	both have been unworthy and deserve the retribution of the wrath
	of God. This can appear to be a humble act,139 and can140 indeed

	become141 a rivalry in baseness142 and in guilt. It is not love for
	Godʹs creation and the holiness that is His gift forever. Can His Son
	condemn himself and still remember Him?
	S 2 C 4 Here the goal is to separate from God the Son He loves, and
	keep him from his Source. This goal is also sought by those who
	seek the role of martyr at anotherʹs hand. Here must the aim be
	clearly seen, for this may pass as meekness and as charity instead of
	cruelty. Is it not kind to be accepting of anotherʹs spite, and not
	respond except with silence and a gentle smile? Behold, how good
	are you who bear with patience and with saintliness the anger and
	the hurt another gives, and do not show the bitter pain you feel.
	S 2 C 5 Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will often hide behind a cloak like
	this. It shows the face of suffering and pain, in silent proof of guilt
	and of the ravages of sin. Such is the witness that it offers one who
	could be savior, not an enemy. But having made him143 enemy, he
	must accept the guilt and heavy‐laid reproach that thus is put upon
	him. Is this love? Or is it rather treachery to one who needs
	salvation from the pain of guilt? What is it for,144 except to keep the
	witnesses of guilt away from love?
	S 2 C 6 Forgiveness‐to‐destroy can also take the form of bargaining
	and compromise. ʺI will forgive you if you meet my needs, for in
	your slavery is my release.” Say this to anyone and you are slave.
	And you will seek to rid yourself of guilt in further bargains which
	can give no hope, but only greater pain and misery. How fearful
	has forgiveness now become, and how distorted is the end it seeks.
	Have mercy on yourself who bargained145 thus. God gives and does
	not ask for recompense. There is no giving but to give like Him. All
	else is mockery. For who would try to strike a bargain with the Son
	of God, and thank his Father for his holiness? S(17)

	S 2 C 7 What would you show your brother? Would you try to
	reïnforce his guilt and thus your own? Forgiveness is the means for
	your escape. How pitiful it is to make of it a146 means for further
	slavery and pain. Within the world of opposites there is a way to
	use forgiveness for the goal of God, and find the peace He offers
	you. Take nothing else, or you have sought your death, and prayed
	for separation from your Self. Christ is for all because He is in all.147
	It is His face forgiveness lets you see. It is His face in which you
	see148 your own.
	S 2 C 8 All forms forgiveness takes that do not lead away from
	anger, condemnation, and comparisons of every kind are death. For
	that is what their purposes have set. Be not deceived by them, but
	lay them by as worthless in their tragic offerings. You do not want
	to stay in slavery. You do not want to be afraid of God. You want
	to see the sunlight and the glow of Heaven shining on the face of
	earth, redeemed from sin and in the Love of God. From here is
	prayer released, along with you. Your wings are free, and prayer
	will lift you up and bring you home where God would have you be.
	D. Forgiveness‐for‐Salvation
	S 2 D 1 Forgiveness‐for‐salvation has one form, and only one. It
	does not ask for proof of innocence, nor pay of any kind. It does not
	argue, nor evaluate the errors that it wants to overlook. It does not
	offer gifts in treachery, nor promise freedom while it asks for death.

	younger of them said to his
	father, "Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.' So he divided
	to them his livelihood. And
	not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far
	country, and there wasted
	his possessions with prodigal living. But when he had spent all, there arose a
	severe famine in that land,
	and he began to be in want. Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of
	that country, and he sent
	him into his fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have filled his stomach
	with the pods that the
	swine ate, and no one gave him anything. "But when he came to himself, he
	said, "How many of my
	father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
	hunger! I will arise and go to
	my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and
	before you, and I am no
	longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired
	servants."'
	"And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off,
	his father saw him and had
	compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to
	him, "Father, I have
	sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called
	your son.'
	"But the father said to his servants, "Bring out the best robe and put it on
	him, and put a ring on his
	hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and
	let us eat and be merry; for
	this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they
	began to be merry.
	"Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the
	house, he heard music and
	dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
	And he said to him, "Your
	brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father
	has killed the fatted
	calf.'
	"But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and
	pleaded with him. So he
	answered and said to his father, "Lo, these many years I have been serving
	you; I never transgressed
	your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I
	might make merry with
	my friends. But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your
	livelihood with harlots, you
	killed the fatted calf for him.'
	"And he said to him, "Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is
	yours. It was right that we
	should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again,
	and was lost and is

	this sorry path for you. What you have chosen still can be undone,

	that should be enough. Forgiveness has a Teacher Who will fail in
	nothing. Rest a while in this; do not attempt to judge forgiveness,
	nor to set it in an earthly frame. Let it arise to Christ, Who
	welcomes it as gift to Him. He will not leave you comfortless,162 nor
	fail to send His angels down to answer you in His Own Name. He
	stands beside the door to which forgiveness is the only key. Give it
	to Him to use instead of you, and you will see the door swing

	HEALING
	<em>a</em>. Introduction
	S 3 <em>a</em> 1 Prayer has both aids and witnesses which make the steep
	ascent more gentle and more sure, easing the pain of fear and
	offering the comfort and the promises of hope. Forgivenessʹs163
	witness and an aid to prayer, a giver of assurance of success in
	ultimate attainment of the goal, is healing. Its importance should
	not be too strongly <em>emphasised</em>, for healing is a sign or symbol of
	forgivenessʹs164 strength, and only an effect or shadow of a change of
	mind about the goal of prayer.
	B. The Cause of Sickness
	S 3 B 1 Do not mistake effect for cause, nor think that sickness is
	apart and separate from what its cause must be. It is a sign, a

	case, so it should be
	“apostrophe s” -- From "<em>a</em> Manual of Style" (12th ed., University of
	Chicago Press, 1969):

	VI‐24
	shadow of an evil thought that seems to have reality and to be just,
	according to the usage of the world. It is external proof of inner
	ʺsin,ʺ 165 and witnesses to unforgiving thoughts that injure and
	would hurt the Son of God. Healing the body is impossible, and
	this is shown by the brief nature of the “cure.” The body yet must
	die, and healing it is but a brief delay in its return166 to dust,167 where
	it was born and will go back.168
	S 3 B 2 The bodyʹs source169 is unforgiveness of the Son of God. It
	has not left its source, and in its pain and aging and the mark of
	death upon it this is clearly shown. Fearful and frail it seems to be
	to those who think their life is tied to its command and linked to its
	unstable, tiny breath. Death stares at them as every moment goes
	irrevocably past their grasping hands, which cannot hold them back.
	And they feel fear as bodies change and sicken. For they sense the
	heavy scent of death upon their hearts.
	S 3 B 3 The body can be healed as an effect of true forgiveness.
	Only that can give remembrance170 of immortality, which is the gift
	of holiness and love. Forgiveness must be given by a mind which
	understands that it must overlook all shadows on the holy face of
	Christ, among which sickness should be seen as one. Nothing but
	that; the sign of judgement made by brother upon brother, and the
	Son of God upon himself. For he has damned his body as his
	prison, S(21) and forgot that it is he who gave this role to it.
	S 3 B 4 What he has done now must Godʹs Son undo. But not alone.
	For he has thrown away the prisonʹs key; his holy sinlessness and
	the remembrance of his Fatherʹs Love. Yet Help is given to him in
	the Voice his Father placed in him. The power to heal is now his
	Fatherʹs gift, for through His Voice He still can reach His Son,

	reminding him the body may become his chosen home, but it will
	never be his home in truth.
	C. False versus True Healing171
	S 3 C 1 Distinctions therefore must be made between true healing
	and its faulty counterpart. The world of opposites is healingʹs place,
	for what in Heaven could there be to heal? As prayer within the
	world can ask amiss and seeming charity forgive to kill, so healing
	can be false as well as true; a witness to the power of the world or to
	the everlasting Love of God.
	S 3 C 2 False healing merely makes a poor exchange172 of one
	illusion for a ʺnicerʺ one; a dream of sickness for a dream of health.
	This can occur at lower forms of prayer, combining with forgiveness
	kindly meant but not completely understood as yet. Only false
	healing can give way to fear, so sickness will be apt173 to strike
	again. False healing can indeed remove a form of pain and sickness.
	But the cause remains, and will not lack effects. The cause is still the
	wish to die and overcome the Christ. And with this wish is death a
	certainty, for prayer <em>is</em> answered. Yet there is a kind of seeming
	death that has a different source. It does not come because of
	hurtful thoughts and raging anger at the universe. It merely
	signifies the end has come for usefulness of body functioning. And
	so it is discarded as a choice, as one lays174 by a garment now
	outworn.
	S 3 C 3 This is what death should be; a quiet choice, made joyfully
	and with a sense of peace, because the body has been kindly used to
	help the Son of God along the way he goes to God. We thank the
	body, then, for all the service it has given us. But we are thankful,
	too, the need is done to walk the world of limits, and to reach the
	Christ in hidden forms and clearly seen at most in lovely flashes.

	Now we can behold Him without blinders,175 in the light that we
	S(22) have learned176 to look upon again.
	S 3 C 4 We call it death, but it is liberty. It does not come in forms
	that seem to be thrust down in pain upon unwilling flesh, but as a
	gentle welcome to release. If there has been true healing, this can be
	the form in which death comes when it is time to rest a while from
	labor gladly done and gladly ended. Now we go in peace to freer
	air and gentler climate, where it is not hard to see the gifts we gave
	were saved for us. For Christ is clearer now; His vision more
	sustained in us; His Voice, the Word of God,177 more certainly our
	own.
	S 3 C 5 This gentle passage to a higher prayer, a kind forgiveness of
	the ways of earth, can only be received with thankfulness. Yet first
	true healing must have come to bless the mind with loving pardon
	for the sins it dreamed about and laid upon the world. Now are its
	dreams dispelled in quiet rest. Now its forgiveness comes to heal
	the world and it is ready to depart in peace,178 the journey over and
	the lessons learned.
	S 3 C 6 This is not death according to the world, for death is cruel in
	its frightened eyes and takes the form of punishment for sin. How
	could it be a blessing, then, and how could it be welcome when it
	must be feared? What healing has occurred in such a view of what
	is merely opening the gate to higher prayer and kindly justice done?
	Death is reward and not a punishment. But such a viewpoint must
	be fostered by the healing that the world cannot conceive. There is
	no partial healing. What but shifts illusions has done nothing.
	What is false cannot be partly true. If you are healed your healing is
	complete. Forgiveness is the only gift you give and would receive.

	anything made that hath been made. In him was life; and the life was the light
	of men. And the light
	shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.

	VI‐27
	S 3 C 7 False healing rests upon the bodyʹs cure, leaving the cause
	of illness still unchanged, ready to strike again until it brings a cruel
	death in seeming victory. It can be held at bay a little while, and
	there can be brief respite as it waits to take its vengeance on the Son
	of God. Yet it cannot be overcome until all faith in it has been laid
	by, and placed upon Godʹs S(23) substitute for evil dreams; a world
	in which there is no veil of sin to keep it dark and comfortless. At
	last the gate of Heaven opens and Godʹs Son is free to enter in the
	home that stands ready to welcome him, and was prepared before
	time was and still but179 waits for him.
	D. Separation versus Union
	S 3 D 1 False healing heals the body in a part, but never as a whole.
	Its separate goals become quite clear in this, for it has not removed
	the curse of sin that lies on it. Therefore it still deceives. Nor is it
	made by one who understands the other is exactly like himself, for it
	is this that makes true healing possible. When false, there is some
	power that another has, not equally bestowed on both as one. Here
	is the separation shown. And here the meaning of true healing has
	been lost, and idols have arisen to obscure the unity that is the Son
	of God. S(24)
	S 3 D 2 Healing‐to‐separate may seem to be a strange idea. Yet180 it
	can be said of any form of healing that is based on inequality of any
	kind. These forms may heal the body, and indeed are generally
	limited to this. Someone knows better, has been better trained, or is
	perhaps more talented and wise. Therefore, he can give healing to
	the one who stands beneath him in his patronage. The healing of
	the body can be done by this because, in dreams, equality cannot be
	permanent. The shifts and change are what the dream is made of.
	To be healed appears to be to find a wiser one who, by his arts and
	learning, will succeed.
	179 Typewritten alternative to “but” is “must”
	180 FIP adds “And” before “Yet”
	PROOF COPY 1819
	Volume VI Song of Prayer
	VI‐28
	S 3 D 3 Someone knows better; this the magic phrase by which the
	body seems to be the aim of healing as the world conceives of it.
	And to this wiser one another goes to profit by his learning and his
	skill; to find in him the remedy for pain. How can that be? True
	healing cannot come from inequality assumed and then accepted as
	the truth, and used to help restore the wounded and to calm the
	mind that suffers from the agony of doubt.
	S 3 D 4 Is there a role for healing, then, that one can use to offer
	help for someone else? In arrogance the answer must be “no.”
	Yet181 in humility there is indeed a place for helpers. It is like the
	role that helps in prayer, and lets forgiveness be what it is meant to
	be. You do not make yourself the bearer of the special gift that
	brings the healing. You but recognise your oneness with the one
	who calls for help. For in this oneness is his separate sense
	dispelled, and it was this that made him sick. There is no point in
	giving remedy apart from where the source of sickness is, for never
	thus can it be truly healed.
	S 3 D 5 Healers there are, for they are Sons of God who recognise
	their Source, and understand that all their Source creates is one with
	them. This is the remedy that brings relief which cannot fail. It will
	remain to bless for all eternity. It heals no part, but wholly and
	forever. Now the cause of every malady has been revealed exactly
	as it is. And in that place is written now the holy Word of S(25)
	God. Sickness and separation must be healed by love and union.
	Nothing else can heal as God established healing. Without Him
	there is no healing, for there is no love.
	S 3 D 6 Godʹs Voice alone can tell you how to heal. Listen, and you
	will never fail to bring His kindly remedy to those He sends to you,
	to let Him heal them, and to bless all those who serve with Him in
	healingʹs name. The bodyʹs healing will occur because its cause has
	gone. And now without a cause, it cannot come again in different
	form. Nor will death any more be feared because it has been

	understood. There is no fear in one who has been truly healed, for
	love has entered now where idols used to stand, and fear has given
	way at last to God.182
	E. The Holiness of Healing
	S 3 E 1 How holy are the healed! For in their sight their brothers
	share their healing and their love. Bringers of peace ‐ the Holy
	Spiritʹs voice,183 through whom He speaks for God, Whose Voice He
	is ‐ such are Godʹs healers. They but speak for Him and never for
	themselves. They have no gifts but those they have from God. And
	these they share because they know that this is what He wills. They
	are not special. They are holy. They have chosen holiness, and
	given up all separate dreams of special attributes through which
	they can bestow unequal gifts on those less fortunate. Their healing
	has restored their wholeness so they can forgive, and join the song
	of prayer in which the healed sing of their union and their thanks to
	God.
	S 3 E 2 As witness to forgiveness, aid to prayer, and the effect of
	mercy truly taught, healing is blessing. And the world responds in
	quickened chorus through the voice of prayer. Forgiveness shines
	its merciful reprieve upon each blade of grass and feathered wing
	and all the living things upon the earth. Fear has no haven here, for
	love has come in all its holy oneness. Time remains only to let the
	last embrace of prayer rest on the earth an instant, as the world is
	shined away. This instant is the goal of all true healers, whom the
	Christ has taught to see His likeness and to teach like Him.184
	S 3 E 3 Think what it means to help the Christ to heal! Can anything
	be holier S(26) than this? God thanks His healers, for He knows the
	Cause of healing is Himself, His Love, His Son, restored as His
	182 1 John 4:18 “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear,
	because fear involves torment.
	But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.”

	likeness: and let them have
	dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over
	the cattle, and over all the
	earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. And God
	created man in his own

	completion and returned to share with Him creationʹs holy joy. Do
	not ask partial healing, nor accept an idol for remembrance185 of
	Him Whose Love has never changed and never will. You are as
	dear to Him as is the whole of His creation, for it is186 in you as His
	eternal gift. What need have you for shifting dreams within a sorry
	world? Do not forget the gratitude of God. Do not forget the holy
	grace of prayer. Do not forget forgiveness of Godʹs Son.
	S 3 E 4 You first forgive, then pray, and you are healed. Your
	prayer has risen up and called to God, Who hears and answers. You
	have understood that you forgive yourself and pray for you187 and188
	in this understanding you are healed. In prayer you have united
	with your Source, and understood that you have never left. This
	level cannot be attained until there is no hatred in your heart, and
	no desire to attack the Son of God. Never forget this; it is you who
	are Godʹs Son, and as you choose to be to him so are you to yourself,
	and God to you.189

	give the role to Him you see in His creation. Thus have you become
	“creator”190 in His place, and He becomes191 no longer Cause but
	only an effect. Now healing is impossible, for on Him lies the
	blame192 for your deception and your guilt. He Who is Love is

	S 3 E 9 Listen, My child, Your Father calls to you. Do not refuse to

	Heaven is here and Heaven is your home. Creation leans across the

	1. <em>the</em> <em>dream</em> <em>of fear</em>
	G 1 <em>a</em> 1. Fear1 is the emotion of the world.2 It has but one.3 Its
	forms are many – call them what you will – but it is one in content.
	Never far, even in form, from what its purpose is, never with power
	to escape its cause, and never but a counterfeit of peace,4 it rests
	uncertainly
	upon a bed of lies. Here it was born and sheltered by its
	seeming comfort. Here it remains5 where it was born, and where its
	end will come. For here is nothingness, where neither birth nor
	death is real, nor any form in the misshapen mind that spawned it6
	has any meaning in the Mind of God.
	G 1 <em>a</em> 2. If you were certain – wholly sure and with consistent grasp
	of what the world can give – fear would be laid aside as easily as joy
	and peace unite on love’s behalf. But first there must be certainty
	that there can be no love where fear exists, and that the world will
	never give a gift that7 is not made of fear, concealed perhaps, but
	which is8 surely present somewhere in the gift. Accept it not, and
	you will understand a gift far greater has been given you.
	G 1 <em>a</em> 3. Let not the world deceive you. It was made to be deception.
	Yet its snares can be so easily escaped a little child can walk
	through safely, and without a care that would arrest its progress.
	Dreams are dreams, and every one is equally untrue. This is the
	only lesson to be learned. Yet will fear linger until every one is rec‐

	ognized as nothingness, and seen exactly as it is and nothing more.
	There is no person, thing, or circumstance that you can value as
	your own without the “gift” of fear arising in your heart. For you
	have seen them all as they are not, and love for them has fled as if
	from you. And you will think that God has ceased to care for you
	who have betrayed the Son He loves, and chosen fear and guilt to be
	their friends.9
	G 1 <em>a</em> 4. Does God deceive or does the world? For it is sure that
	one must lie. There is no point at which their thoughts agree, their
	gifts unite in kind or purpose. What you take from one the other
	will obscure. 10 There is no hope of compromise G(2) in this. Nor
	can there be a shifting of the mind between the two without the fear
	that every dream must bring. How fearful it must be to see yourself
	as maker of reality and truth, the lord of11 destiny and time’s domain,
	and arbiter appointed for the world.
	G 1 <em>a</em> 5. Dreams never change. Remember only this, but do not let
	it slip away at times and let yourself give way to fear again. Deny
	the dream but do not fail the truth, for12 what is true alone13 will
	never fail. All else deceives,14 all else will terrify, and even when it
	seems to please the most it brings with it a heavy cost of pain. Be
	free of suffering now. There is no cost for any gift that comes to you
	from God. His way is certain, for His gifts remain forever as He
	gave them. Do not think that fear can enter where His gifts abide.
	But do not think His gifts can be received where fear has entered15
	and has touched your sight with gross distortions that the world
	thinks real.

	replaces with “your.” Then the
	whole phrase is crossed out and “to be your friends” becomes “in place of
	him.”

	G 1 <em>a</em> 6. There are no scraps of dreams. Each one contains the
	whole of fear, the opposite of love, (in all its ways),16 the hell that
	hides the memory of God, the crucifixion of His holy Son. Therefore,
	be vigilant against them all, for in their single purpose they are
	one, and hell is total. It can seem to be17 forever for this lesson to be
	learned, and yet it need not be. I came to speak in time of timelessness.
	Have you not learned the pain of dreaming yet? There is no
	need to hug it to your heart, and to forget the dreadful cost of salvaging
	despair and building up deceptions once again.
	G 1 <em>a</em> 7. The tiniest of dreams, the smallest wish for values of the
	world is large enough to stand between you and the sweet release
	that God would offer you. He cannot choose to change His Son, nor
	make your mind accept the perfect freedom He has given you. Yet
	it is certain you will turn to Him and suddenly remember. But be
	sure of this and do not let it slip away:18
	What God has joined is one. And one as well is everything that
	fear has made to be the great deceiver and the substitute for
	God’s G(3) creation. You can choose but one, and which you
	choose is total. Everything the world can offer promises some
	joy that it will never give. And everything that God has promised
	you will never fail in anything. No need will be unmet, no
	hurt unhealed, no sorrow kept unchanged, no darkness undispelled.
	The smallest pain will vanish suddenly before His
	gifts.19

	conceal the gifts of God unless you want it so. In peace I come,
	and urge you now to make an end to time and step into eternity
	with me. There will not be a change that eyes can see, nor will you
	disappear from things of time. But you will hold my hand as you
	return because we come together. Now the hosts of Heaven come
	with us, to sweep away all vestiges of dreams and every thought
	that rests on nothingness.
	G 1 <em>a</em> 9. How dear are you to God, Who asks but that you walk
	with me and bring His light into a sickened world which fear has
	drained of love and life and hope.23 Surely you will not fail to hear
	my call,24 for I have never failed to hear your cries of pain and
	grief,25 and I have come to save and to redeem the world at last from
	fear. It never was, nor is, nor yet will be what you imagine. Let me
	see for you, and judge for you what you would look upon. When
	you have seen with me but once, you would no longer value any
	fearful thing at cost of glory and the peace of God.

	22 T 31H 1 Temptation has <em>one</em> lesson it would teach, in ALL its
	forms, WHEREVER it occurs. It
	would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must die, unable
	to escape its frailty,
	and bound by what it orders him to feel. It sets the limits on what he can do;
	its power is the only
	strength he has; his grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. Would you BE this, if
	Christ appeared to you in
	all His glory, asking you but this, “Choose once again if you would take your
	place among the Saviours
	of the world, or would remain in hell, and hold your brothers there.” For He
	<em>has</em> come, and He <em>is</em>
	asking this.
	T 31H 6 You ARE as God created you, and so is every living thing you look
	upon, <em>regardless</em> of
	the images you see. What you behold as sickness and as pain, as weakness and
	as suffering and loss, is
	but temptation to perceive <em>yourself</em> defenseless and in hell. Yield
	<em>not</em> to this, and you will see
	ALL pain in <em>every</em> form WHEREVER it occurs but disappear as mists
	before the sun. A miracle has
	come to heal God’s Son, and close the door upon his dreams of weakness,
	opening the way to his salvation
	and release. Choose once again what you would have him be, remembering that
	every choice you
	make establishes your own identity as you will see it, and believe it
	<em>is</em>.

	G 2 <em>a</em> 1. How28 can you be delivered from all gifts the world has
	offered you? How can you change these little, cruel offerings for
	those that Heaven gives and God would have you keep? Open your
	hands, and give all things to me that you have held against your holiness
	and kept as slander on the Son of God. Practice with every
	one you recognise as what it is. Give me these worthless things the
	instant that you see them through my eyes29 and understand their
	cost. Then give away these bitter dreams as you perceive them now
	to be but that, and nothing more than that.
	G 2 <em>a</em> 2. I take them from you gladly, laying them beside the gifts of
	God that He has placed upon the altar to His Son. And these I give
	to you to take the place of those you gave away30 in mercy on yourself.
	These are the gifts I ask, and only these. For as you lay them by you
	reach to me, and I can come as savior then to you. The gifts of God
	are in my hands, to give to anyone who would exchange the world
	for Heaven.31 You need only call my Name,32 and ask me to accept
	the gift of pain from willing hands that would be laid in mine,33 with

	31 T 11 D 9. Long ago we said that God so loved the world that He gave it to
	His only-begotten Son.
	(that whosoever believeth on him should never see death). God DOES love the
	real world, and those
	who perceive its reality cannot see the world of death. For death is not of
	the real world, in which everything
	is eternal. God gave you the real world in exchange for the one you made, out
	of your split
	mind, and which <em>is</em> the symbol of death. For if you could REALLY
	separate yourselves from the Mind
	of God, you <em>would</em> die. And the world you perceive <em>is</em> a world
	of separation.
	T 11 I 9. The real world was given you by God, in loving exchange for the
	world YOU made, and
	which you see. But take it from the hand of Christ, and look upon it. Its
	reality will make everything
	else invisible, for beholding it is <em>total</em> perception. And as you look
	upon it, you will remember that it
	was always so. Nothingness will become invisible, for you will at last have
	seen truly. Redeemed perception
	is easily translated into knowledge, for ONLY perception is capable of error.
	And perception
	has never been. Being corrected, it gives place to knowledge, which is forever
	the ONLY reality. The
	Atonement is but the way back to what was never lost. Your Father could not
	cease to love His Son.

	33 The theme of holding hands is frequently used in the Text as a metaphor for
	loving relationship between

	thorns laid down and nails long thrown away as one by one the
	sorry gifts of earth are joyously relinquished. In my hands is everything
	you want and need and hoped to find among the shabby toys
	of earth. I take them all from you and they are gone. And shining
	in the place where once they stood there is a gateway to another
	world through which we enter in the Name of God.
	G 2 <em>a</em> 3. Father, we thank You for these gifts that we have found
	together. Here we are redeemed. For it is here we joined, and from
	this place of holy joining we will come to You because we recognise
	the gifts You gave and would have nothing else. Each hand that
	finds its way to mine will take34 Your gifts from me, and as we look
	T 8 E 23 I DO go before you, because I <em>am</em> beyond the ego. Reach
	therefore for my hand because you
	<em>want</em> to transcend the ego. My will, will <em>never</em> be wanting,
	and if you want to share it YOU <em>will</em>.
	I give it willingly and gladly, because I need YOU as much as you need
	<em>me</em>.
	T 17 F 11. In your newness, remember that you have started again,
	<em>together</em>. And take
	each other’s hand, to walk together along a road far more familiar than you
	now believe. Is it
	not certain, that you will remember a goal unchanged throughout eternity? For
	you have
	chosen but the goal of God, from which your true intent was <em>never</em>
	absent. Throughout the
	Sonship is the song of freedom heard, in joyous echo of your choice. You have
	joined with
	many, in the holy instant, and <em>they</em> have joined with you. Think not
	your choice will leave
	YOU comfortless. For God Himself has blessed your special relationship.
	<em>join</em> in His blessing,
	and withhold not yours upon it. For all it needs now <em>is</em> your
	blessing, that you may see
	that in it rests salvation.
	T 18 D 5. You who hold each other’s hand also hold mine, for when you joined
	each other you
	were not alone. Do you believe that I would leave you in the darkness you
	agreed to leave
	with <em>me</em>? In your relationship is this world’s light. And fear
	<em>must</em> disappear before you
	now. Be tempted not to snatch away the gift of faith you offered to each
	other. You will succeed
	only in frightening yourselves. The gift is given forever, for God Himself
	received it. You
	CANNOT take it back. You have accepted God. The holiness of your relationship
	is established
	in Heaven. You do not understand what you accepted, but remember that your
	understanding
	is not necessary. All that was necessary was merely the <em>wish</em> to
	understand. That
	wish was the desire to be holy. The will of God is granted you. For you desire
	the only thing
	you ever had, or ever were.
	T 24 C 7 […] Here stands your brother with the key to Heaven in his hand, held
	out to you.
	Let not the dream of specialness remain between you. What is one <em>is</em>
	joined in truth.
	T 31 H 10 Salvation’s song will echo through the world with every choice they
	make. For we
	are one in purpose, and the end of hell is near. In joyous welcome is my hand
	outstretched to
	every brother who would join with me in reaching past temptation, and who
	looks with fixed
	determination toward the light that shines beyond in perfect constancy.

	illusion, where all gifts of fear were born. For now creation could
	not be like its Creator, Who could never leave what He Himself created
	part of Him. Now must there be a substitute for love, which
	cannot have an opposite in truth and, being all, can have no substitute.
	42 So fear was made, and with it came the need for gifts to lend
	the substance to the43 dream in which there is no substance. Now
	the dream seems to have value, for its offerings appear as hope and
	strength and even love, if only for an instant. They content the
	frightened dreamer for a little while, and let him not remember the
	first dream which gifts of fear but offer him again.44
	G 3 <em>a</em> 2. The seeming solace of illusions’ gifts are now his armor,
	and the sword he holds to save himself from waking. For before he
	could awaken, he would first be forced to call to mind the first
	dream once again.45 It is not God Who asks a price of him, but having
	drawn a veil across the truth, he now must let the veil be drawn
	away so that its lack of substance can be seen. No one would hesitate
	to leave46 a dream of shock and terror, merciless decay and sickening
	contortions,47 with despair always in sight and death not far
	behind, if he believed that it was48 but a dream. Yet if he thinks that
	he must first go through a greater terror still, he must see hope in
	what will now appear the “better” dream.

	4. <em>our</em> GIFT TO <em>God</em>
	G 4 <em>a</em> 1. There71 is no gift of faith that God does not accept with
	gratitude. He loves His Son. And as He gives His gifts to him, so is
	He grateful for the gifts His Son gives Him. Gratitude is the song of
	Heaven,72 the single harmony of73 all creation at one with its Creator.
	For gratitude is love expressed in joining; the necessary condition74
	for extension and the prerequisite for peace. And who can be
	in conflict and love God?
	G 4 <em>a</em> 2. We have discussed the gifts of God to you. Now we must
	also speak of those that you can give to Him. For it is75 these that
	render76 His giving, complete,77 as it is His to you that make you
	whole. Giving is joy and holiness and healing. Here is your answer
	to the world, and God’s as well. For here it is you join with Him,
	His likeness being yours in this alone.78
	G 4 <em>a</em> 3. How can you give to Him Who has no lack, no need, no
	emptiness,79 no unlit place which needs a light that you can offer
	Him? He saves your gifts for you. He does not know of giving and
	receiving. What is love, or comes from love, or offers love a gift, is
	one to Him because it is of Him. To Him and from Him are not different
	to One Who has no opposite. For love is all there is and everything
	there is. A gift to love is given everyone, not lessening the
	giver, nor in truth adding to the receiver. More than love there cannot
	be. But this a gift becomes if it is truly given and received by
	both to both who know that they are one:

	G 4 <em>a</em> 4. What more would God hold dearer,81 than this? These are
	His gifts as G(11) much as they are yours, for in them giver and receiver
	join. A gift is holy only when there is no sense of82 all of who
	will gain thereby, and not a shadow of a thought of loss. It is not
	easy in the world to know what giving means, and how to give a
	gift that God and all creation will accept as shining outward from a
	thankful heart and inward to the altar of its God.
	G 4 <em>a</em> 5. God gives the83 grace to give as He must give, for He must
	give the only way He knows, and what He knows is everything He
	is. Christ gives as He does, being like Himself. And nothing stands
	outside the gifts They give, for every gift is all‐encompassing and
	lifts the universe into Their arms.84

	G 4 <em>a</em> 7. This is the only lesson that the world must teach in giving.
	It is not the one the world was made to teach. And yet it is the one
	the Holy Spirit sees in it, and so it is the only one it has. Forget the
	other devastating ways the gifts of earth are given and received.
	Forget the cost, the thoughts of loss and gain, the bargaining, the
	counting of the score, the world associates with every gift it gives in
	strict accordance with its laws. The money‐changers of the marketplace
	have been your teachers.88 Now they need a gift they could
	not give. Be savior now to them because you have another Teacher

	G 5 <em>a</em> 1. There100 is a secret place in everyone in which God’s gifts
	are laid, and his to Him. It is not secret to the eyes of Christ Who
	sees it plainly and unceasingly. Yet it is hidden to the body’s eyes,
	and to those still invested in the world and caring for the petty gifts
	it gives, esteeming them and thinking they are real. Illusions’ gifts
	will hide the secret place where God is clear as day, and Christ with

	all‐in‐all, extension of herself, as much a part of her as breath itself.
	He loves you as a brother loves his own, born of one father, still as
	one in him, and bonded with a seal that cannot break. He loves you
	as a lover loves his own; his chosen one, his joy, his very life, the one
	he seeks when she has gone away, and brings him peace again on

	would his self be incomplete, whose immortality completes his own,
