<h2 id="sectionA">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea. It is the pivot upon which <em>all</em> compromise, <em>all</em> desperate attempts to strike a bargain, and <em>all</em> conflicts achieve a seeming balance. It is the symbol of the central theme that <em>somebody 	must lose</em>. Its focus on the body is apparent, for it is always an attempt to <em>limit loss</em>. The body is itself a sacrifice; a giving up of power in the name of saving just a little for yourself. To see a brother in another body, separate from yours, is the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and sacrifice the rest. Look at the world, and you will see nothing attached to anything beyond itself. All seeming entities can come a little nearer, or go a little farther off, but <em>cannot</em> join.</p>

<h2 id="sectionB">B. The “Sacrifice” of Oneness</h2>

<p>The world you see is based on “sacrifice” of oneness. It is a picture of complete disunity and total lack of joining. Around each entity is built a wall so seeming solid that it looks as if what is inside can never reach without, and what is out can never reach and join with what is locked away, within the wall. Each part must sacrifice the other part, to keep itself complete. For if they joined, each one would lose its own identity, and by their separation are their selves maintained.</p>

<p>
The little that the body fences off <em>becomes</em> the self,
preserved through sacrifice of all the rest. And all the rest
must <em>lose</em> this little part, remaining incomplete to keep its
own identity intact. In this perception of yourself, the body’s
loss would be a sacrifice indeed. For sight of bodies becomes
the sign that sacrifice is limited, and something still remains
for you alone. And for this little to belong to you, are limits
placed on everything outside, just as they are on everything
you think is yours. For giving and receiving <em>are</em> the same.
And to accept the limits of a body is to impose these limits on
each brother whom you see. For you must see him as you see
yourself.
</p>

<p>
The body <em>is</em> a loss, and <em>can</em> be made to sacrifice. And
while you see your brother as a body, apart from you and
separate in his cell, you are demanding sacrifice of him <em>and</em>
you. What greater sacrifice could be demanded than that
God’s Son perceive himself without his Father? And his Father
be without His Son? Yet every sacrifice demands that
they be separate and without the other. The memory of God
<em>must</em> be denied if any sacrifice is asked of anyone. What
witness to the wholeness of God’s Son is seen within a world
of separate bodies, however much he witnesses to truth? He is
<em>invisible</em> in such a world. Nor can his song of union and of
love be heard at all. Yet is it given him to make the world recede
before his song, and sight of him replace the body’s eyes.
</p>

<p>
Those who would see the witnesses to truth instead of
to illusion merely ask that they might see a purpose in the
world that gives it sense, and makes it meaningful. Without
your special function <em>has</em> this world no meaning for you. Yet
it can become a treasure house as rich and limitless as Heaven
itself. No instant passes here in which your brother’s holiness
cannot be seen, to add a limitless supply to every meagre
scrap and tiny crumb of happiness that you allot yourself.
</p>

<p>
You <em>can</em> lose sight of oneness, but can <em>not</em> make sacrifice
of its reality. Nor can you <em>lose</em> what you would sacrifice,
nor keep the Holy Spirit from His task of showing you
that it has not been lost. Hear, then, the song your brother
sings to you. And let the world recede, and take the rest his
witness offers on behalf of peace. But judge him not, for you
will hear no song of liberation for yourself, nor see what it is
given him to witness to, that you may see it and rejoice with
him. Make not his holiness a sacrifice to your belief in sin.
You sacrifice <em>your</em> innocence with his, and die each time you
see in him a sin deserving death.
</p>

<p>
Yet every instant can you be reborn, and given life
again. His holiness gives life to you, who cannot die because
his sinlessness is known to God, and can no more be sacrificed
by you than can the light in you be blotted out because he
sees it not. You who would make a sacrifice of life, and make
your eyes and ears bear witness to the death of God and of His
holy Son, think not that you have power to make of Them
what God willed not They be. In Heaven, God’s Son is not
imprisoned in a body, nor is sacrificed in solitude to sin.
</p>

<p>
And as he is in Heaven, so must he be eternally and
everywhere. He is the same forever. Born again each instant,
untouched by time, and far beyond the reach of any sacrifice
of life or death. For neither did he make, and only one was
given him, by One Who knows His gifts can never suffer sacrifice
and loss. God’s justice rests in gentleness upon His Son,
and keeps him safe from all injustice the world would lay
upon him. Could it be that <em>you</em> could make his sins reality,
and sacrifice his Father’s Will for him?
</p>

<p>
Condemn him not by seeing him within the rotting
prison where he sees himself. It is your special function to ensure
the door be opened, that he may come forth to shine on
you, and give you back the gift of freedom by receiving it of
you. What is the Holy Spirit’s special function but to release
the holy Son of God from the imprisonment he made to <em>keep</em>
himself from justice? Could your function be a task apart and
separate from His Own?
</p>

<h2 id="sectionC">C. The Forms of Error</h2>

<p>
It is not difficult to understand the reasons why you do
not ask the Holy Spirit to solve <em>all</em> problems for you. He has
not a greater difficulty in resolving some than others. Every
problem is the same to Him, because each one is solved in just
the <em>same</em> respect, and through the <em>same</em> approach. The aspects
which need solving do not change, whatever form the
problem seems to take. A problem can appear in many forms,
and it will do so while the problem lasts. It serves no purpose
to attempt to solve it in a special form. It will recur and then
recur again and yet again, until it has been answered for all
time, and will not rise again in any form. And only then are
you released from it.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit offers you release from <em>every</em> problem
that you think you have. They are the same to Him because
each one, regardless of the form it seems to take, is a
demand that someone suffer loss, and make a sacrifice that
you might gain. And when the situation is worked out so no
one loses, is the problem gone, because it was an error in perception
which now has been corrected. One mistake is not
more difficult for Him to bring to truth than is another. For
there <em>is</em> but one mistake; the whole idea that loss is possible,
and could result in gain for anyone. If this were true, then
God would be unfair: sin would be possible, attack be justified,
and vengeance fair.
</p>

<p>
This one mistake, in any form, has <em>one</em> correction.
There <em>is</em> no loss: to think there is, is a mistake. You <em>have</em> no
problems, though you think you have. And yet you could not
think so, if you saw them vanish one by one, without regard to
size, complexity, or place and time, or any attribute which you
perceive that makes each one seem different from the rest.
Think not the limits you impose on what you see can limit
God in any way.
</p>

<p>
The miracle of justice can correct <em>all</em> errors. Every
problem <em>is</em> an error. It does injustice to the Son of God, and
therefore is not true. The Holy Spirit does not evaluate
injustices as great or small, or more or less. They have no
properties to Him. They are mistakes from which the Son of
God is suffering, but needlessly. And so He takes the thorns
and nails away. He does not pause to judge whether the hurt
be large or little. He makes but one judgement: that to hurt
God’s Son <em>must</em> be unfair, and therefore is not so.
</p>

<p>
You who believe it safe to give but some mistakes to be
corrected while you keep the others to yourself, remember
this: Justice is total. There is no such thing as partial justice. If
the Son of God is guilty then is he condemned, and he deserves
no mercy from the God of justice. But ask not God to
punish him because <em>you</em> find him guilty, and would have
him die. God offers you the means to see his innocence.
Would it be fair to punish him because you will not look at
what is there to see? Each time you keep a problem for yourself
to solve, or judge that it is one which has no resolution,
you have made it great, and past the hope of healing. You
deny the miracle of justice <em>can</em> be fair.
</p>

<p>
If God is just, then can there be no problems that justice
cannot solve. But you believe that some injustices are fair and
good, and necessary to preserve yourself. It is these problems
that you think are great, and cannot be resolved. For there are
those you <em>want</em> to suffer loss, and no one whom you wish to
be preserved from sacrifice entirely. Consider once again your
special function. <em>One</em> is given you to see in him his perfect
sinlessness. And you will ask no sacrifice of him, because you
could not will he suffer loss. The miracle of justice you call
forth will rest on you as surely as on him. Nor will the Holy
Spirit be content until it is received by everyone. For what you
give to Him <em>is</em> everyone’s, and by your giving it can He ensure
that everyone receives it equally.
</p>

<p>
Think, then, how great your own release will be, when
you are willing to receive correction for all your problems.
You will not keep one, for pain in any form you will not want.
And you will see each little hurt resolved before the Holy
Spirit’s gentle sight. For all of them <em>are</em> little in His sight, and
worth no more than just a tiny sigh before they disappear, to
be forever undone and unremembered. What seemed once to
be a special problem, a mistake without a remedy, or an affliction
without a cure, has been transformed into a universal
blessing. Sacrifice is gone. And in its place the Love of God
can be remembered, and will shine away all memory of sacrifice
and loss.
</p>

<p>
God cannot be remembered until justice is loved instead
of feared. He cannot be unjust to anyone or anything,
because He knows that everything that is belongs to Him, and
will forever be as He created it. Nothing He loves but must be
sinless and beyond attack. Your special function opens wide
the door beyond which is the memory of His Love kept perfectly
intact and undefiled. And all you need to do is but to
wish that Heaven be given you instead of hell, and every bolt
and barrier that seems to hold the door securely barred and
locked will merely fall away, and disappear. For it is not your
Father’s Will that you should offer or receive less than He
gave, when He created you in perfect love.
</p>

<h2 id="sd">D. The Borderland</h2>

<p>
Complexity is not of God. How could it be, when all
He knows is one? He knows of <em>one</em> creation, <em>one</em> reality,
<em>one</em> truth, and but <em>one</em> Son. Nothing conflicts with oneness.
How, then, could there be complexity in Him? What is there
to decide? For it is conflict that makes choice possible. The
truth is simple: it is one, without an opposite. And how could
strife enter in its simple presence, and bring complexity where
oneness is? The truth makes no decisions, for there is nothing
to decide <em>between</em>. And only if there were could choosing
be a necessary step in the advance toward oneness. What is
everything leaves room for nothing else.
</p>

<p>
Yet is this magnitude beyond the scope of this curriculum.
Nor is it necessary we dwell on anything that cannot be
immediately grasped. There is a borderland of thought which
stands between this world and Heaven. It is not a place, and
<em>when</em> you reach it is <em>apart</em> from time. Here is the meeting
place where thoughts are brought together; where conflicting
values meet, and all illusions are laid down beside the
truth, where they are judged to be untrue. This borderland is
just beyond the gate of Heaven. Here is every thought made
pure and wholly simple. Here is sin denied, and everything
that <em>is</em> received instead.
</p>

<p>
This is the journey’s end. We have referred to it as the
real world. And yet there is a contradiction here, in that the
words imply a limited reality, a partial truth, a segment of the
universe made true. This is because knowledge makes no attack
upon perception. They are brought together, and only
one continues past the gate where Oneness is. Salvation is a
borderland where place and time and choice have meaning
still, and yet it can be seen that they are temporary, out of
place, and every choice has been already made.
</p>

<p>
Nothing the Son of God believes can be destroyed. But
what is truth to him must be brought to the last comparison
that he will ever make, the last evaluation that will be possible,
the final judgement upon this world. It is the judgement of the
truth upon illusion, of knowledge on perception: it has
no meaning, and does not exist. This is not your decision. It is
but a simple statement of a simple fact. But in this world there
<em>are</em> no simple facts, because what is the same and what is different
remain unclear. The one essential thing to make a
choice at all is this distinction. And hereïn lies the difference
between the worlds. In this one, choice is made impossible. In
the real world is choosing simplified.
</p>

<p>
Salvation stops just short of Heaven, for only perception
needs salvation. Heaven was never lost, and so cannot be
saved. Yet who can make a choice between the wish for
Heaven and the wish for hell unless he recognises they are
<em>not</em> the same? This difference is the learning goal this course
has set. It will not go beyond this aim. Its only purpose is to
teach what is the same and what is different, leaving room to
make the only choice which <em>can</em> be made.
</p>

<p>
There is no basis for choice in this complex and over
complicated world. For no one understands what is the same,
and seems to choose where no choice really is. The real world
is the area of choice made real, not in the outcome, but in the
perception of <em>alternatives</em> for choice. That there <em>is</em> choice
is an illusion. Yet within this one lies the undoing of <em>every</em>
illusion, not excepting this.
</p>

<p>
Is not this like your special function, where the separation
is undone by change of purpose in what once was specialness,
and now is union? <em>All</em> illusions are but one. And in
the recognition this is so, lies the ability to give up all attempts
to choose between them, and to <em>make</em> them different. How
simple is the choice between two things so clearly <em>UN</em>alike.
There <em>is</em> no conflict here. No sacrifice is possible in the relinquishment
of an illusion <em>recognised</em> as such. Where all
reality has been withdrawn from what was never true, can it
be hard to give it up, and choose what <em>must</em> be true?
</p>

<h2 id="se">
E. Where Sin Has Left
</h2>

<p>
Forgiveness is this world’s equivalent of Heaven’s justice.
It translates the world of sin into a simple world, where
justice can be reflected from beyond the gate behind which total
lack of limits lies. Nothing in boundless love could need
forgiveness. And what is charity within the world gives way
to simple justice past the gate that opens into Heaven. No one
forgives unless he has believed in sin, and still believes that he
has much to be forgiven. Forgiveness thus becomes the means
by which he learns he has done nothing to forgive. Forgiveness
always rests upon the one who offers it, until he sees
himself as needing it no more. And thus is he returned to his
real function of creating, which his forgiveness offers him
again.
</p>

<p>
Forgiveness turns the world of sin into a world of glory,
wonderful to see. Each flower shines in light, and every bird
sings of the joy of Heaven. There is no sadness and there is no
parting here, for everything is totally forgiven. And what has
been forgiven must join, for nothing stands between, to keep
them separate and apart. The sinless must perceive that they
are one, for nothing stands between to push the other off. And
in the space which sin left vacant do they join as one, in gladness
recognising what is part of them has not been kept apart
and separate.
</p>

<p>
The holy place on which you stand is but the space that
sin has left. And here you see the face of Christ, arising in its
place. Who could behold the face of Christ, and not recall His
Father as He really is? Who could fear love, and stand upon
the ground where sin has left a place for Heaven’s altar to rise
and tower far above the world, and reach beyond the universe
to touch the heart of all creation? What is Heaven but a song
of gratitude and love and praise, by everything created to the
Source of its creation? The holiest of altars is set where once
sin was believed to be. And here does every light of heaven
come, to be rekindled and increased in joy. For here is what
was lost restored to them, and all their radiance made whole
again.
</p>

<p>
Forgiveness brings no little miracles to lay before the
gate of Heaven. Here the Son of God Himself comes to receive
each gift that brings him nearer to his home. Not one is lost,
and none is cherished more than any other. Each reminds him
of His Father’s Love as surely as the rest. And each one
teaches him that what he feared he loves the most. What <em>but</em>
a miracle could change his mind, so that he understands that
love cannot <em>be</em> feared? What other miracle is there but this?
And what else <em>need</em> there be to make the space between you
disappear?
</p>

<p>
Where sin once was perceived will rise a world which
will become an altar to the truth, and <em>you</em> will join the lights
of Heaven there, and sing their song of gratitude and praise.
And as they come to you to be complete, so will you go with
them. For no one hears the song of Heaven and remains without
a voice that adds its power to the song, and makes it
sweeter still. And each one joins the singing at the altar which
was raised within the tiny spot that sin proclaimed to be its
own. And what was tiny then has soared into a magnitude of
song in which the universe has joined with but a single voice.
This tiny spot of sin that stands between you still is holding
back the happy opening of Heaven’s gate. How little is the
hindrance which withholds the wealth of Heaven from you!
And how great will be the joy in Heaven when you join the
mighty chorus to the Love of God!
</p>

<h2 id="sf">
F. The Little Hindrance
</h2>

<p>
A little hindrance can seem large indeed to those who
do not understand that miracles are all the same. Yet teaching
that is what this course is <em>for</em>. This is its only purpose, for
only that is all there is to learn. And you can learn it many different
ways. All learning is a help or hindrance to the gate of
Heaven. Nothing in between is possible. There are two teachers
only, who point in different ways. And you will go along
the way your chosen teacher leads. There are but two directions
you can take, while time remains and choice is meaningful.
For never will another road be made except the way to
Heaven. You but choose whether to go <em>toward</em> Heaven, or
away to nowhere. There <em>is</em> nothing else to choose.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is meaningless.
For it is but a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless
to the real Teacher of the world. Yet since you <em>do</em> believe
in it, why should you waste it going nowhere, when it
<em>can</em> be used to reach a goal as high as learning can achieve?
Think not the way to Heaven’s gate is difficult at all. Nothing
you undertake with certain purpose and high resolve and
happy confidence, holding each other’s hand and keeping step
to Heaven’s song, is difficult to do. But it is hard indeed to
wander off, alone and miserable, down a road which leads to
nothing, and which has no purpose.
</p>

<p>
God gave His Teacher to replace the one you made, not
to conflict with it. And what He would replace has been replaced.
Time lasted but an instant in your mind, with no effect
upon eternity. And so is all time past, and everything exactly
as it was before the way to nothingness was made. The
tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all
of them within that one mistake, held also the <em>correction</em>
for that one, and all of them that came within the first. And in
that tiny instant time was gone, for that was all it ever was.
What God gave answer to <em>is</em> answered and is gone.
</p>

<p>
To you who still believe you live in time and know not
it is gone, the Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely
small and senseless maze you still perceive in time,
though it has long since gone. You think you live in what is
past. Each thing you look upon you saw but for an instant,
long ago, before its unreality gave way to truth. Not one illusion
still remains unanswered in your mind. Uncertainty was
brought to certainty so long ago that it is hard indeed to hold
it to your heart, as if it were before you still.
</p>

<p>
The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal,
passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to notice it had
come. What disappeared too quickly to affect the simple
knowledge of the Son of God can hardly still be there, for you
to choose to be your teacher. Only in the past – an ancient
past, too short to make a world in answer to creation – did this
world appear to rise. So very long ago, for such a tiny interval
of time, that not one note in Heaven’s song was missed.
</p>

<p>
Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgement,
and in all belief in sin, is that one instant still called
back, as if it could be made again in time. You keep an ancient
memory before your eyes. And he who lives in memories
alone is unaware of where he is.
</p>

<p>
Forgiveness is the great release from time. It is the key
to learning that the past is over. Madness speaks no more.
There <em>is</em> no <em>other</em> teacher and no <em>other</em> way. For what has
been undone no longer is. And who can stand upon a distant
shore, and dream himself across an ocean, to a place and time
that have long since gone by? How <em>real</em> a hindrance can this
dream be to where he really <em>is</em>? For this is fact, and does <em>not</em>
change whatever dreams he has. Yet can he still <em>imagine</em> he
is elsewhere, and in another time. In the extreme he can delude
himself that this is true, and pass from mere imagining
into belief and into madness, quite convinced that where he
would prefer to be, he <em>is</em>.
</p>

<p>Is this a <em>hindrance</em> to the place whereön he stands? Is any echo from the past that he may hear a fact in what is there to hear where he is now? And how much can his own delusions about time and place affect a change in where he really is? The unforgiven is a voice that calls out from a past forever more gone by. And everything which points to it as real is but a wish that what is gone could be made real again, and seen as here and now, in place of what is <em>really</em> now and here. Is this a hindrance to the truth the past is gone, and cannot be returned to you? And do you <em>want</em> that fearful instant kept, when Heaven seemed to disappear, and God was feared and made a symbol of your hate?</p>

<p>
Forget the time of terror that has been so long ago corrected
and undone. Can sin withstand the Will of God?
Can it be up to you to see the past, and put it in the present?
You can <em>not</em> go back. And everything that points the way in
the direction of the past but sets you on a mission whose accomplishment
can only be unreal. Such is the justice your
Ever-Loving Father has ensured must come to you. And from
your own unfairness to yourself has He protected you. You
<em>cannot</em> lose your way because there is no way but His, and
nowhere can you go except to Him.
</p>

<p>
Would God allow His Son to lose his way along a road
long since a memory of time gone by? This course will teach
you <em>only</em> what is now. A dreadful instant in a distant
past, now perfectly corrected, is of no concern or value. Let
the dead and gone be peacefully forgotten. Resurrection has
come to take its place. And now you are a part of resurrection,
<em>not</em> of death. No past illusions have the power to keep you
in a place of death, a vault God’s Son entered an instant, to be
instantly restored unto His Father’s perfect Love. And how
can he be kept in chains long since removed, and gone forever
from his mind?
</p>

<p>
The Son that God created is as free as God created him.
He was reborn the instant that he chose to die instead of live.
And will you not forgive him now, because he made an error
in the past that God remembers not, and is not there? Now
you are shifting back and forth between the past and present.
Sometimes the past seems real, as if it were the present.
Voices from the past are heard, and then are doubted. You are
like to one who still hallucinates, but lacks conviction in what
he perceives. This is the borderland between the worlds, the
bridge between the past and present. Here the shadow of the
past remains, but still a present light is dimly recognised.
Once it is seen, this light can never be forgotten. It must draw
you from the past into the present, where you really <em>are</em>.
</p>

<p>
The shadow voices do not change the laws of time or
of eternity. They come from what is past and gone, and hinder
not the true existence of the here and now. The real world
is the second part of the hallucination time and death are
real, and have existence which can <em>be</em> perceived. This terrible
illusion was denied in but the time it took for God to give His
answer to illusion for all time and every circumstance. And
then it was no more, to be experienced as there.
</p>

<p>
Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant
that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant
when the time of terror was replaced by love. And so you die
each day to live again, until you cross the gap between the
past and present, which is not a gap at all. Such is each life: a
seeming interval from birth to death, and on to life again, a
repetition of an instant gone by long ago, which cannot <em>be</em> relived.
And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is
still here and now.
</p>

<p>
Forgive the past and let it go, for it <em>is</em> gone. You stand
no longer on the ground that lies between the worlds. You
have gone on, and reached the world that lies at Heaven’s
gate. There is no hindrance to the Will of God, nor any need
that you repeat again a journey that was over long ago. Look
gently on each other, and behold the world in which perception
of your hate has been transformed into a world of love.
</p>

<h2 id="sg">
G. The Appointed Friend
</h2>

<p>
Anything in this world that you believe is good and
valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so.
Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you
have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real. And it <em>is</em>
real to you. It is <em>not</em> nothing. And through its perceived reality
has entered all the world of sick illusions. All belief in
sin, in power of attack, in hurt and harm, in sacrifice and
death, has come to you. For no one can make <em>one</em> illusion
real, and still escape the rest. For who can choose to keep the
ones which he prefers, and find the safety that the truth alone
can give? Who can believe illusions are the same, and still
maintain that even one is best?
</p>

<p>
Lead not your little lives in solitude, with one illusion
as your only friend. This is no friendship worthy of God’s
Son, nor one with which he could remain content. Yet God
has given him a better Friend, in whom all power in earth and
Heaven rests. The one illusion that <em>you</em> think is friend obscures
<em>His</em> grace and majesty from you, and keeps his friendship
and forgiveness from your welcoming embrace. Without
him you <em>are</em> friendless. Seek not another friend to take his
place. There <em>is</em> no other friend. What God appointed has no
substitute, for what illusion can replace the truth?
</p>

<p>
Who dwells with shadows is alone indeed, and loneliness
is not the Will of God. Would you allow one shadow to
usurp the throne that God appointed for your Friend, if you
but realised its emptiness has left <em>yours</em> empty and unoccupied?
Make no illusion friend, for if you do, it can but take the
place of him whom God has called your Friend. And it is he
who is your <em>only</em> Friend in truth. He brings you gifts that
are not of this world, and only he to whom they have been
given can make sure that you receive them. He will place
them on your throne, when you make room for him on his.

H. Review of Principles
</h2>

<p>
This is a course in miracles. And as such, the laws of
healing must be understood before the purpose of the course
can be accomplished. Let us review the principles that we
have covered, and arrange them in a way that summarises all
that must occur for healing to be possible. For when it once is
possible it <em>must</em> occur. All sickness comes from separation.
When the separation is denied, it goes. For it <em>is</em> gone as soon
as the idea which brought it has been healed, and been replaced
by sanity. Sickness and sin are seen as consequence
and cause, in a relationship kept hidden from awareness that it
may be carefully preserved from reason’s light.
</p>

<p>
Guilt <em>asks</em> for punishment, and its request is granted.
Not in truth, but in the world of shadows and illusions built
on sin. The Son of God perceives what he would see because
perception <em>is</em> a wish fulfilled. Perception changes, made to
take the place of changeless knowledge. Yet is truth unchanged.
It cannot be perceived, but only known. What is
perceived takes many forms, but none has meaning. Brought
to truth, its senselessness is quite apparent. Kept apart from
truth, it seems to have a meaning and be real.
</p>

<p>
Perception’s laws are opposite to truth, and what is
true of knowledge is not true of anything that is apart from it.
Yet has God given answer to the world of sickness, which applies
to <em>all</em> its forms. God’s Answer is eternal, though it operates
in time, where it is needed. Yet because it <em>is</em> of God, the
laws of time do not affect its workings. It is in this world, but
not a part of it. For it is real, and dwells where all reality must
be. Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to
be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected
out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all,
but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source.
</p>

<p>
God’s Answer lies where the belief in sin must be, for
only there can its effects be utterly undone, and without cause.
Perception’s laws must be reversed because they <em>are</em> reversals
of the laws of truth. The laws of truth forever will be
true, and cannot <em>be</em> reversed; yet can be <em>seen</em> as upside-down.
And this must be corrected where the illusion of reversal
lies.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible that one illusion be less amenable to
truth than are the rest. But it <em>is</em> possible that some are given
greater value, and less willingly offered to truth for healing
and for help. No illusion has any truth in it. Yet it appears
some are more true than others, although this clearly makes
no sense at all. All that a hierarchy of illusions can show is
preference, not reality. What relevance has preference to the
truth? Illusions are illusions, and are false. Your preference
gives them no reality. Not one is true in any way, and all must
yield with equal ease to what God gave as answer to them all.
God’s Will is One. And any wish that seems to go against His
Will has <em>no</em> foundation in the truth.
</p>

<p>
Sin is not error, for it goes beyond correction to impossibility.
Yet the belief that it is real has made some errors seem
forever past the hope of healing, and the lasting grounds for
hell. If this were so, would Heaven be opposed by its own
opposite, as real as it. Then would God’s Will be split in two,
and all creation be subjected to the laws of two opposing powers,
until God becomes impatient, splits the world apart, and
relegates attack unto Himself. Thus has He lost His Mind,
proclaiming sin has taken His reality from Him, and brought
His Love at last to vengeance’s heels. For such an insane picture,
an insane defence can be expected, but can <em>not</em> establish
that the picture must be true.
</p>

<p>
Nothing gives meaning where no meaning is. And
truth <em>needs</em> no defence to make it true. Illusions have no
witnesses, and no effects. Who looks on them is but deceived.
Forgiveness is the only function here, and serves to bring the
joy this world denies to every aspect of God’s Son where sin
was thought to rule. Perhaps you do not see the role forgiveness
plays in ending death, and all beliefs that rise from mists
of guilt.
</p>

<p>Sins are beliefs which you impose between your brother and your self. They limit you to time and place, and give a little space to you, another little space to him. This separating off is symbolised, in your perception, by a body which is clearly separate and a thing apart. Yet what this symbol represents is but your wish to <em>be</em> apart and separate. Forgiveness takes <em>away</em> what stands between your brother and yourself. It is the wish that you be joined with him, and <em>not</em> apart. We call it “wish” because it still conceives of other choices, and has not yet reached beyond the world of choice entirely.</p>

<p>
Yet is this wish in line with Heaven’s state, and not in
opposition to God’s Will. Although it falls far short of giving
you your full inheritance, it <em>does</em> remove the obstacles which
you have placed between the Heaven where you are, and
recognition of where and what you are. Facts are unchanged.
Yet facts can be denied and thus unknown, though they were
known <em>before</em> they were denied.
</p>

<p>
Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish
that what is true be true; a little willingness to overlook what
is not there; a little sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference
to this world which death and desolation seem to rule. In joyous
answer will creation rise within you, to replace the world
you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and complete. What is
forgiveness but a willingness that truth be true? What can remain
unhealed and broken from a Unity Which holds all
things within Itself? There <em>is</em> no sin. And every miracle is
possible the instant that the Son of God perceives his wishes
and the Will of God are One.
</p>

<p>
What is the Will of God? He wills His Son have everything.
And this He guaranteed when He created him <em>as</em> everything.
It is impossible that anything be lost, if what you
<em>have</em> is what you <em>are</em>. This is the miracle by which creation
became your function, sharing it with God. It is not understood
apart from Him, and therefore has no meaning in this
world.
</p>

<p>
Here does the Son of God ask not too much, but far too
little. He would sacrifice his own identity with everything, to
find a little treasure of his own. And this he cannot do
without a sense of isolation, loss and loneliness. This is the
treasure he has sought to find. And he could only be afraid of
it. Is fear a treasure? Can uncertainty be what you <em>want</em>?
Or is it a mistake about your will, and what you <em>really</em> are?
Let us consider what the error is, so it can be corrected, not
protected.
</p>

<p>
Sin is belief attack can be projected outside the mind
where the belief arose. Here is the firm conviction that ideas
<em>can</em> leave their source made real and meaningful. And from
this error does the world of sin and sacrifice arise. This world
is an attempt to prove your innocence, while cherishing attack.
Its failure lies in that you <em>still</em> feel guilty, though without
understanding <em>why</em>. Effects are seen as separate from their
source, and seem to be beyond you to control or to prevent.
What is thus <em>kept</em> apart can never join.
</p>

<p>
Cause and Effect are one, not separate. God wills you
learn what always has been true; that He created you as part
of Him, and this must still be true <em>because</em> ideas leave not
their source. Such is creation’s law: that each idea the mind
conceives but <em>adds</em> to its abundance, <em>never</em> takes away.
This is as true of what is idly wished as what is truly willed,
because the mind can wish to be deceived, but cannot make it
be what it is not. And to believe ideas can leave their source is
to invite illusions to be true, <em>without success</em>. For never
will success be possible in trying to deceive the Son of God.
</p>

<p>
The miracle is possible when cause and consequence
are brought together, not kept separate. The healing of effect
without the cause can merely shift effects to other forms. And
this is <em>not</em> release. God’s Son could never be content with
less than full salvation, and escape from guilt. For otherwise
he still demands that he must make some sacrifice, and thus
denies that everything is his, unlimited by loss of any kind. A
tiny sacrifice is just the same in its effects as is the whole idea
of sacrifice. If loss in any form is possible, then is God’s Son
made incomplete and not himself. Nor will he know
himself, nor recognise his will. He has forsworn his Father
<em>and</em> himself, and made them both his enemies in hate.
</p>

<p>
Illusions serve the purpose they were made to serve.
And from their purpose, they derive whatever meaning that
they seem to have. God gave to all illusions that were made
<em>another</em> purpose that would justify a miracle whatever
form they took. In every miracle all healing lies, for God gave
answer to them all as one. And what is one to Him must be
the same. If you believe what is the same is different you but
deceive yourself. What God calls one will be forever one, not
separate. His Kingdom <em>is</em> united; thus it was created, and
thus will it ever be.
</p>

<p>
The miracle but calls your ancient name, which you
will recognise because the truth is in your memory. And to
this name your brother calls for his release and yours. Heaven
is shining on the Son of God. Deny him not, that you may be
released. Each instant is the Son of God reborn, until he
chooses not to die again. In every wish to hurt he chooses
death, instead of what his Father wills for him. Yet every instant
offers life to him, because his Father wills that he should
live.
</p>

<p>
In crucifixion is redemption laid, for healing is not
needed where there is no pain or suffering. Forgiveness is the
answer to attack of any kind. So is attack deprived of its effects,
and hate is answered in the name of love. To you to
whom it has been given to save the Son of God from crucifixion
and from hell and death, all glory be forever. For you have
power to save the Son of God because his Father willed that it
be so. And in your hands does all salvation lie, to be both offered
and received as one.
</p>

<p>
To use the power God has given you as He would
have it used is natural. It is not arrogant to be as He created
you, or to make use of what He gave to answer all His Son’s
mistakes, and set him free. But it <em>is</em> arrogant to lay aside the
power that He gave, and choose a little, senseless wish instead
of what He wills. The gift of God to you <em>is</em> limitless. There
is no circumstance it cannot answer, and no problem
which is not resolved within its gracious light.
</p>

<p>
Abide in peace, where God would have you be. And
be the means whereby your brother finds the peace in which
your wishes are fulfilled. Let us unite in bringing blessing to
the world of sin and death. For what can save each one of us
can save us all. There is no difference among the Sons of God.
The Unity that specialness denies will save them all, for what
is one can have no specialness. And everything belongs to
each of them. No wishes lie between a brother and his own.
To get from one is to deprive them all. And yet to bless but
one gives blessing to them all as one.
</p>

<p>
Your ancient name belongs to everyone, as theirs to
you. Call on your brother’s name and God will answer, for on
Him you call. Could He refuse to answer when He has <em>already</em>
answered all who call on Him? A miracle can make
no change at all. But it Can make what always has been true
be recognised by those who know it not. And by this little gift
of truth but let to be itself; the Son of God allowed to be himself,
and all creation freed to call upon the Name of God as
one.
</p>

I. The Immediacy of Salvation
</h2>

<p>
The one remaining problem that you have is that you
see an interval between the time when you forgive, and will
receive the benefits of trust. This but reflects the little you
would keep between yourselves, that you might be a little
separate. For time and space are one illusion, which takes different
forms. If it has been projected beyond your minds, you
think of it as time. The nearer it is brought to where it is, the
more you think of it in terms of space.
</p>

<p>
There is a distance you would keep apart from one another,
and this space you see as time because you still believe
you are external to each other. This makes trust impossible.
And you cannot believe that trust would settle every problem
<em>now</em>. Thus do you think it safer to remain a little careful and
a little watchful of interests perceived as separate. From this
perception you cannot conceive of gaining what forgiveness
offers <em>now</em>. The interval you think lies in between the giving
and receiving of the gift seems to be one in which you sacrifice
and suffer loss. You see eventual salvation, not immediate results.
</p>

<p>
Salvation <em>is</em> immediate. Unless you so perceive it, you
will be afraid of it, believing that the risk of loss is great between
the time its purpose is made yours and its effects will
come to you. In this form is the error still obscured that is the
source of fear. Salvation <em>would</em> wipe out the space you see
between you still, and let you instantly become as one. And it
is <em>here</em> you fear the loss would lie. Do not project this fear to
time, for time is not the enemy that you perceive. Time is as
neutral as the body is, except in terms of what you see it <em>for</em>.
If you would keep a little space between you still, you want a
little time in which forgiveness is withheld a little while. This
makes the interval between the time in which forgiveness is
withheld and given seem dangerous, with terror justified.
</p>

<p>
Yet space between you is apparent <em>now</em>, and cannot be
perceived in future time. No more can it be overlooked except
within the present. Future loss is not your fear. But present
<em>joining</em> is your dread. Who can feel desolation except
<em>now</em>? A future cause as yet has no effects. And therefore
must it be that if you fear, there is a <em>present</em> cause. And it is
<em>this</em> that needs correction, not a future state.
</p>

<p>
The plans you make for safety all are laid within the future,
where you <em>cannot</em> plan. No purpose has been given it
as yet, and what will happen has as yet no cause. Who can
predict effects without a cause? And who could fear effects
unless he thought they <em>had</em> been caused, and judged disastrous
<em>now</em>? Belief in sin arouses fear, and like its cause, is
looking forward; looking back, but <em>overlooking</em> what is
here and now. Yet only here and now its cause must be, if its
effects already have been judged as fearful. And in overlooking
this, is it protected and kept separate from healing. For a
miracle is <em>now</em>. It stands already here, in present grace,
within the only interval of time which sin and fear have overlooked,
but which is all there <em>is</em> to time. The working out of
all correction takes no time at all.
</p>

<p>
Yet the <em>acceptance</em> of the working out can seem to
take forever. The change of purpose the Holy Spirit brought
to your relationship has in it all effects that you will see. They
can be looked at <em>now</em>. Why wait until they unfold in time, and
fear they may not come, although already there? You have
been told that everything brings good that comes from God.
And yet it seems as if this is not so. Good in disaster’s form is
difficult to credit in advance. Nor is there really sense in this
idea.
</p>

<p>Why should the good appear in evil’s form? And is it not deception if it does? Its cause is here, if it appears at all. Why are not its effects apparent, then? Why in the future? And you seek to be content with sighing, and with “reasoning” you do not understand it now, but will some day. And then its meaning will be clear. This is not reason, for it is unjust, and clearly hints at punishment until the time of liberation is at hand. Given a change of purpose for the good, there is no reason for an interval in which disaster strikes, to be perceived as “good” some day, but now in form of pain. This is a sacrifice of <em>now</em>, which could not be the cost the Holy Spirit asks for what He gave without a cost at all. </p>

<p>Yet this illusion has a cause which, though untrue, must be already in your mind. And this illusion is but one effect which it engenders, and one form in which its outcome is perceived. This interval in time, when retribution is perceived to be the form in which the “good” appears is but one aspect of
the little space that lies between you, unforgiven still.</p>

<p>Be not content with future happiness. It has no meaning, and is <em>not</em> your just reward. For you have cause for freedom <em>now</em>. What profits freedom in a prisoner’s form? Why should deliverance be disguised as death? Delay is senseless, and the “reasoning” which would maintain effects of present cause must be delayed until a future time is merely a denial of the fact that consequence and cause must come as one. Look not to time, but to the little space between you still, to be delivered from. And do not let it be disguised as time, and so preserved because its form is changed, and what it <em>is</em> cannot be recognised. The Holy Spirit’s purpose <em>now</em> is yours. Should not His happiness be yours as well?</p>

<h2 id="s10">
J. For They Have Come
</h2>

<p>
Think but how holy you must be from whom the Voice
for God calls lovingly unto your brother, that you may awake
in him the Voice that answers to your call! And think how
holy he must be when in him sleeps your own salvation, with
his freedom joined! However much you wish he be condemned,
God is in him. And never will you know He is in
you as well while you attack His chosen home, and battle with
His host. Regard him gently. Look with loving eyes on him
who carries Christ within him, that you may behold His glory,
and rejoice that Heaven is not separate from you.
</p>

<p>
Is it too much to ask a little trust for him who carries
Christ to you, that you may be forgiven all your sins, and left
without a single one you cherish still? Forget not that a
shadow held between your brother and yourself obscures the
face of Christ and memory of God. And would you trade
Them for an ancient hate? The ground whereön you stand is
holy ground because of Them Who, standing there with you,
have blessed it with Their innocence and peace.
</p>

<p>
The blood of hatred fades to let the grass grow green
again, and let the flowers be all white and sparkling in the
summer sun. What was a place of death has now become a
living temple in a world of light. Because of Them. It is Their
Presence which has lifted holiness again to take its ancient
place upon an ancient throne. Because of Them have miracles
sprung up as grass and flowers on the barren ground which
hate had scorched and rendered desolate. What hate has
wrought have They undone. And now you stand on ground
so holy Heaven leans to join with it, and make it like itself.
The shadow of an ancient hate has gone, and all the blight and
withering have passed forever from the land where They have
come.
</p>

<p>
What is a hundred or a thousand years to Them, or tens
of thousands? When They come, time’s purpose is fulfilled.
What never was passes to nothingness when They have come.
What hatred claimed is given up to love, and freedom
lights up every living thing and lifts it into Heaven, where the
lights grow ever brighter as each one comes home. The incomplete
is made complete again, and Heaven’s joy has been
increased because what is its own has been restored to it. The
bloodied earth is cleansed, and the insane have shed their
garments of insanity, to join Them on the ground whereön you
stand.
</p>

<p>
Heaven is grateful for this gift of what has been withheld
so long. For They have come to gather in Their Own.
What has been locked is opened; what was held apart from
light is given up, that light may shine on it, and leave no space
nor distance lingering between the light of Heaven and the
world.
</p>

<p>
The holiest of all the spots on earth is where an ancient
hatred has become a present love. And They come quickly to
the living temple, where a home for Them has been set up.
There is no place in Heaven holier. And They have come to
dwell within the temple offered them, to be Their resting place
as well as yours. What hatred has released to love becomes
the brightest light in Heaven’s radiance. And all the lights in
Heaven brighter grow, in gratitude for what has been restored.
</p>

<p>
Around you angels hover lovingly, to keep away all
darkened thoughts of sin, and keep the light where it has entered
in. Your footprints lighten up the world, for where you
walk forgiveness gladly goes with you. No one on earth but
offers thanks to one who has restored his home, and sheltered
him from bitter winter and the freezing cold. And shall the
Lord of Heaven and His Son give less in gratitude for so much
more?
</p>

<p>
Now is the temple of the Living God rebuilt as host
again to Him by Whom it was created. Where He dwells, His
Son dwells with Him, never separate. And They give thanks
that They are welcome made at last. Where stood a cross
stands now the risen Christ, and ancient scars are healed
within His sight. An ancient miracle has come to bless and to
replace an ancient enmity that came to kill. In gentle
gratitude do God the Father and the Son return to what is
Theirs, and will forever be. Now is the Holy Spirit’s purpose
done. For They have come! For They have come at last!
</p>

<h2 id="s11">
K. The Remaining Task
</h2>

<p>
What, then, remains to be undone, for you to realise
Their Presence? Only this: you have a differential view of
when attack is justified, and when you think it is unfair, and
not to be allowed. When you perceive it as unfair, you think
that a response of anger now is just. And thus you see what is
the same as different. Confusion is not limited. If it occurs at
all, it will be total. And its presence, in whatever form, will
hide Their Presence. They are known with clarity, or not at all.
Confused perception will block knowledge. It is not a question
of the size of the confusion, or how much it interferes. Its
simple presence shuts the door to Theirs, and keeps Them
there unknown.
</p>

<p>
What does it mean if you perceive attack in certain
forms to be unfair to you? It means that there must be some
forms in which you think it <em>fair</em>. For otherwise, how could
some be evaluated as unfair? Some, then, are given meaning,
and perceived as sensible. And only some are seen as meaningless.
And this denies the fact that <em>all</em> are senseless:
equally without a cause or consequence, and cannot have effects
of <em>any</em> kind. Their Presence is obscured by any veil
which stands between Their shining innocence, and your
awareness it is your own, and <em>equally</em> belongs to every living
thing along with you. God limits not. And what is limited
can <em>not</em> be Heaven. So it <em>must</em> be hell.
</p>

<p>
Unfairness and attack are <em>one</em> mistake, so firmly
joined that where one is perceived, the other must be seen.
You cannot <em>be</em> unfairly treated. The belief you are is but another
form of the idea you are deprived by someone not yourself.
Projection of the cause of sacrifice is at the root of everything
perceived to be unfair, and not your just deserts. Yet it is
<em>you</em> who ask this of yourself, in deep injustice to the Son of
God. You have no enemy except yourself, and you are enemy
indeed to him because you do not know him <em>as</em> yourself.
What could be more unjust than that he be deprived of what
he <em>is</em>, denied the right to be himself, and asked to sacrifice
his Father’s Love and yours, as not his due?
</p>

<p>
Beware of the temptation to perceive yourself unfairly
treated. In this view, you seek to find an innocence which is
not Theirs but yours alone, and at the cost of someone else’s
guilt. Can innocence be purchased by the giving of your guilt
to someone else? And <em>is</em> this innocence, which your attack on
him attempts to get? Is it not retribution for your own attack
upon the Son of God you seek? Is it not safer to believe that
you are innocent of this, and victimised despite your innocence?
Whatever way the game of guilt is played, there <em>must</em>
be loss. Someone must lose his innocence that someone else
can take it from him, making it his own.
</p>

<p>
You think your brother is unfair to you because you
think that one must be unfair to make the other innocent. And
in this game do you perceive one purpose for your whole relationship.
And this you seek to add unto the purpose given it.
The Holy Spirit’s purpose is to let the Presence of your holy
Guests be known to you. And to this purpose nothing <em>can</em>
be added, for the world is purposeless except for this. To add
or take away from this <em>one</em> goal is but to take away all purpose
from the world and from yourself. And each unfairness
that the world appears to lay upon you, <em>you</em> have laid on <em>it</em>
by rendering it purposeless, without the function that the Holy
Spirit sees. And simple justice has been thus denied to every
living thing upon the earth.
</p>

<p>
What this injustice does to you who judge unfairly, and
who see as you have judged, you cannot calculate. The world
grows dim and threatening, and not a trace of all the happy
sparkle that salvation brought can you perceive, to lighten up
your way. And so you see yourself deprived of light, abandoned
to the dark, unfairly left without a purpose in a futile
world. The world is fair because the Holy Spirit has brought
injustice to the light within, and there has all unfairness been
resolved, and been replaced with justice and with love. If you
perceive injustice anywhere, you need but say:
</p>

<blockquote>
“By this do I deny the Presence of the Father and the Son.<br />
And I would rather know of Them than see injustice,<br />
which Their Presence shines away.”
</blockquote>
