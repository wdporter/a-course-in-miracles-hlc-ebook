<h2 id="s1">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
	The new beginning now becomes the focus of the curriculum. The goal is clear,
	but now you need specific methods for attaining it. The speed by which it can
	be reached depends on this one thing alone: your willingness to practice every
	step. Each one will help a little every time it is attempted. And together
	will these steps lead you from dreams of judgement to forgiving dreams and out
	of pain and fear. They are not new to you, but they are more ideas than rules
	of thought to you as yet. So now we need to practice them awhile, until they
	are the rules by which you live. We seek to make them habits now, so you will
	have them ready for whatever need.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">
	B. Rules for Decision
</h2>

<p>
	Decisions are continuous. You do not always know when you are making them. But
	with a little practice with the ones you recognise, a set begins to form which
	sees you through the rest. It is not wise to let yourself become preöccupied
	with every step you take. The proper set, adopted consciously each time you
	wake, will put you well ahead. And if you find resistance strong and
	dedication weak, you are not ready. <em>Do not fight yourself</em>. But think
	about the kind of day you want, and tell yourself there <em>is</em> a way in
	which this very day can happen just like that. Then try again to have the day
	you want.
</p>

<p>
	(1) The outlook starts with this:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“Today I will make no decisions by myself.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	This means that you are choosing not to be the judge of what to do. But it
	must also mean you will not judge the situations where you will be called upon
	to make response. For if you judge them, you have set the rules for how you
	should reäct to them. And then another answer cannot but produce confusion and
	uncertainty and fear.
</p>

<p>
	This is your major problem now. You still make up your mind, and <em>then</em>
	decide to ask what you should do. And what you hear may not resolve the
	problem as <em>you</em> saw it first. This leads to fear because it
	contradicts what you perceive, and so you feel attacked. And therefore angry.
	There are rules by which this will not happen. But it does occur at first,
	while you are learning how to hear.
</p>

<p>
	(2) Throughout the day, at any time you think of it, and have a quiet moment
	for reflection, tell yourself again the kind of day you want; the feelings you
	would have, the things you want to happen to you, and the things you would
	experience, and say:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“If I make no decisions by myself,<br />
	This is the day that will be <em>given</em> me.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	These two procedures, practiced well, will serve to let you be directed
	without fear, for opposition will not first arise and then become a problem in
	itself.
</p>

<p>
	But there will still be times when you have judged already. Now the answer
	will provoke attack, unless you quickly straighten out your mind to want an
	answer that will work. Be certain this has happened if you feel yourself
	unwilling to sit by, and ask to have the answer given you. This means you
	<em>have</em> decided by yourself, and cannot see the <em>question</em>. Now
	you need a quick restorative before you ask.
</p>

<p>
	(3) Remember once again the day you want, and recognise that something has
	occurred which is not part of it. Then realise that you have asked a question
	by yourself, and must have set an answer in your terms. Then say,
</p>

<blockquote>
	“I have no question. I forgot what to decide.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	This cancels out the terms which you have set, and lets the <em>answer</em>
	show you what the question must have really been.
</p>

<p>
	Try to observe this rule without delay, despite your opposition. For you have
	<em>already</em> gotten angry, and your fear of being answered in a different
	way from what your version of the question asks will gain momentum, until you
	believe the day you want is one in which you get <em>your</em> answer to
	<em>your</em> question. And you will not get it, for it would destroythe day
	by robbing you of what you <em>really</em> want. Thiscan be very hard to
	realise, when once you have decided by yourself the rules which promise you a
	happy day. Yet this decision still can be undone, by simple methods which you
	can accept.
</p>

<p>
	(4) If you are so unwilling to receive you cannot even let your question go,
	you can begin to change your mind with this:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“At least I can decide I do not <em>like</em> what I feel now.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	This much is obvious, and paves the way for the next easy step.
</p>

<p>
	(5) Having decided that you do not like the way you feel, what could be easier
	than to continue with:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“And so I <em>hope</em> I have been wrong.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	This works against the sense of opposition, and reminds you that help is not
	being thrust upon you, but is something that you want and that you need,
	because you do not like the way you feel. This tiny opening will be enough to
	let you go ahead with just a few more steps you need to let yourself be
	helped.
</p>

<p>
	Now you have reached the turning-point, because it has occurred to you that
	<em>you</em> will gain if what you have decided is not so. Until this point is
	reached, you will believe your happiness depends on being <em>right</em>. But
	this much reason have you now attained; you would be better off if you were
	<em>wrong</em>.
</p>

<p>
	(6) This tiny grain of wisdom will suffice to take you further. You are not
	coërced, but merely hope to get a thing you want. And you can say in perfect
	honesty:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“I <em>want</em> another way to look at this.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	Now you have changed your mind about the day, and have remembered what you
	<em>really</em> want. Its purpose has no longer been obscured by the insane
	belief you want it for the goal of being right when you are wrong. Thus is the
	readiness for asking brought to your awareness, for you cannot be in conflict
	when you ask for what you want, and see that it <em>is</em> this for which you
	ask.
</p>

<p>
	(7) This final step is but acknowledgment of lack of opposition to be helped.
	It is a statement of an open mind, not certain yet, but willing to be shown:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“Perhaps there <em>is</em> another way to look at this.<br />
	What can I <em>lose</em> by asking?”
</blockquote>

<p>
	Thus you now can ask a question that makes sense, and so the answer will make
	sense as well. Nor will you fight against it, for you see that it is
	<em>you</em> who will be helped by it.
</p>

<p>
	It must be clear that it is easier to have a happy day if you prevent
	unhappiness from entering at all. But this takes practice in the rules which
	will protect you from the ravages of fear. When this has been achieved, the
	sorry dream of judgement has forever been undone. But meanwhile, you have need
	for practicing the rules for its undoing. Let us, then, consider once again
	the very first of the decisions which are offered here.
</p>

<p>
	We said you can begin a happy day with the determination not to make decisions
	by yourself. This seems to be a real decision in itself. And yet, you
	<em>cannot</em> make decisions by yourself. The only question really is with
	<em>what</em> you choose to make them. That is really all. The first rule,
	then, is not coërcion, but a simple statement of a simple fact. You will not
	make decisions by yourself <em>whatever</em> you decide. For they are made
	with idols or with God. And you ask help of Christ or anti-Christ, and which
	you choose will join with you, and tell you what to do.
</p>

<p>
	Your day is not at random. It is set by what you choose to live it with, and
	how the friend whose counsel you have sought perceives your happiness. You
	always ask advice before you can decide on anything. Let <em>this</em> be
	understood, and you can see there cannot be coërcion here, nor grounds for
	opposition that you may be free. There <em>is</em> no freedom from what must
	occur. And if you think there is, you must be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The second rule as well is but a fact. For you and your adviser must agree on
	what you want before it can occur. It is but this <em>agreement</em> which
	permits all things to happen. Nothing can be caused without some form of
	union, be it with a dream of judgement or the Voice for God. Decisions cause
	results <em>because</em> they are not made in isolation. They are made by you
	and your adviser, for yourself, and for the world as well. The day you want
	you offer to the world, for it will be what you have asked for, and will
	reïnforce the rule of your adviser in the world. Whose kingdom is the world
	for you today? What kind of day will you decide to have?
</p>

<p>
	It needs but two who would have happiness this day to promise it to all the
	world. It needs but two to understand that they cannot decide alone, to
	guarantee the joy they asked for will be wholly shared. For they have
	understood the basic law that makes decision powerful, and gives it all
	effects that it will ever have. It needs but two. These two are joined before
	there <em>can</em> be a decision. Let this be the one reminder that you keep
	in mind, and you will have the day you want, and give it to the world by
	having it yourself. Your judgement has been lifted from the world by your
	decision for a happy day. And as you have received, so must you give.
</p>

<h2 id="s3">
	C. Freedom of Will
</h2>

<p>
	Do you not understand that to oppose the Holy Spirit is to fight
	<em>yourself</em>? He tells you but <em>your</em> will; He speaks for
	<em>you</em>. In His Divinity is but your own. And all He knows is but your
	knowledge, saved for you that you may do your will through Him. God
	<em>asks</em> you do your will. He joins with <em>you</em>. He did not set His
	kingdom up alone. And Heaven itself but represents your will, where everything
	created is for you. No spark of life but was created with your glad consent,
	as you would have it be. And not one Thought that God has ever had but waited
	for your blessing to be born. God is no enemy to you. He asks no more than
	that He hear you call Him ‘Friend’.
</p>

<p>
	How wonderful it is to do your will! For that is freedom. There is nothing
	else that ever should be called by freedom’s name. Unless you do your will you
	are not free. And would God leave His Son without what he has chosen for
	himself? God but ensured that you would never lose your will when He gave you
	His perfect answer. Hear it now, that you may be reminded of His love, and
	learn your will. God would not have His Son made prisoner to what he does not
	want. He <em>joins</em> with you in willing you be free. And to oppose Him is
	to make a choice against <em>yourself</em>, and choose that <em>you</em> be
	bound.
</p>

<p>
	Look once again upon your enemy, the one you chose to hate instead of love.
	For thus was hatred born into the world, and thus the rule of fear established
	there. Now hear God speak to you through Him Who is His Voice and yours as
	well, reminding you that it is not your will to hate, and be a prisoner to
	fear, a slave to death, a little creature with a little life. Your will is
	boundless; it is not your will that it be bound. What lies in you has joined
	with God Himself in all creation’s birth. Remember Him Who has created you,
	and through your will created everything. Not one created thing but gives you
	thanks, for it is by your will that it was born. No light of Heaven shines
	except for you, for it was set in Heaven by your will.
</p>

<p>
	What cause have you for anger in a world which merely waits your blessing to
	be free? If you be prisoner, then God Himself could not be free. For what is
	done to him whom God so loves is done to God Himself. Think not He wills to
	bind you, Who has made you cocreator of the universe along with Him. He would
	but keep your will forever and forever limitless.
</p>

<p>
	This world awaits the freedom you will give when you have recognised that
	<em>you</em> are free. But you will not forgive the world until you have
	forgiven Him Who gave your will to you. For it is <em>by</em> your will the
	world is given freedom. Nor can you be free apart from Him Whose holy Will you
	share. God turns to you to ask the world be saved, for by your own salvation
	it is healed. And no one walks upon the earth but must depend on your
	decision, that he learn death has no power over him because he shares your
	freedom, as he shares your will. It <em>is</em> your will to heal him, and
	because you have decided <em>with</em> him, he is healed. And now is God
	forgiven, for you chose to look upon your brother as a friend.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">
	D. Beyond All Idols
</h2>

<p>
	Idols are quite specific. But your will is universal, being limitless. And so
	it has no form, nor is content for its expression in the terms of form. Idols
	are limits. They are the belief that there are forms which will bring
	happiness, and that, <em>by</em> limiting, is all attained. It is as if you
	said, “I have no need of everything. This little thing I want, and it will be
	as everything to me”. And this must fail to satisfy, because it <em>is</em>
	your will that everything be yours. Decide for idols, and you <em>ask</em> for
	loss. Decide for truth, and everything <em>is</em> yours.
</p>

<p>
	It is not form you seek. What form can be a substitute for God the Father’s
	love? What form can take the place of all the love in the Divinity of God the
	Son? What idol can make two of what is one? And <em>can</em> the limitless be
	limited? You do not <em>want</em> an idol. It is not your will to have one. It
	will not bestow on you the gift you seek. When you decide upon the form of
	what you want, you lose the understanding of its purpose. So you see your will
	within the idol, thus reducing it to a specific form. Yet this could never
	<em>be</em> your will, because what shares in all creation cannot be content
	with small ideas and little things.
</p>

<p>
	Behind the search for every idol lies the yearning for completion. Wholeness
	has no form because it is unlimited. To seek a special person or a thing to
	add to you to make yourself complete can only mean that you believe some form
	is missing. And by finding this, you will achieve completion in a form you
	like. This is the <em>purpose</em> of an idol; that you will not look beyond
	it, to the source of the belief that you <em>are</em> incomplete.
	<em>Only</em> if you had sinned could this be so. For sin is the idea you are
	alone, and separated off from what is whole. And thus it would be necessary
	for the search for wholeness to be made <em>beyond</em> the boundaries of
	limits on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It never is the <em>idol</em> that you want. But what you think it offers you,
	you want indeed, and have the <em>right</em> to ask for. Nor could it be
	possible it be denied. Your will to be complete is but God’s will, and this is
	<em>given</em> you by being His. God knows not form. He cannot answer you in
	terms which have no meaning. And your will could not be satisfied with empty
	forms, made but to fill a gap which is not there. It is not this you
	<em>want</em>. Creation gives no separate person and no separate thing the
	power to complete the Son of God. What idol can be called upon to give the Son
	of God what he already has?
</p>

<p>
	Completion is the <em>function</em> of God’s Son. He has no need to seek for
	it at all. Beyond all idols stands his holy will to be but what he is. For
	more than whole is meaningless. If there were change in him, if he could be
	reduced to any form and limited to what is not in him, he would not be as God
	created him. What idol can he need to be himself? For can he give a part of
	him away? What is not whole cannot make whole. But what is really asked for
	cannot <em>be</em> denied. Your will <em>is</em> granted. Not in any form that
	would content you not, but in the whole completely lovely Thought God holds of
	you.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing that God knows not exists. And what He knows exists forever,
	changelessly. For thoughts endure as long as does the mind that thought of
	them. And in the Mind of God there is no ending, nor a time in which His
	Thoughts were absent, or could suffer change. Thoughts are not born and cannot
	die. They share the attributes of their creator, nor have they a separate life
	apart from his. The thoughts you think are in your mind, as you are in the
	Mind Which thought of you. And so there are no separate parts in what exists
	within God’s Mind. It is forever one, eternally united and at peace.
</p>

<p>
	Thoughts seem to come and go. Yet all this means is that you are sometimes
	aware of them, and sometimes not. An unremembered thought is born again to you
	when it returns to your awareness. Yet it did not die when you forgot it. It
	was always there, but you were unaware of it. The Thought God holds of you is
	perfectly unchanged by your forgetting. It will always be exactly as it was
	before the time when you forgot, and will be just the same when you remember.
	And it is the same within the interval when you forgot.
</p>

<p>
	The Thoughts of God are far beyond all change, and shine forever. They await
	not birth. They wait for welcome and remembering. The Thought God holds of you
	is like a star, unchangeable in an eternal sky. So high in Heaven is it set
	that those outside of Heaven know not it is there. Yet still and white and
	lovely will it shine through all eternity. There was no time it was not there;
	no instant when its light grew dimmer or less perfect ever was.
</p>

<p>
	Who knows the Father knows this light, for He is the eternal sky which holds
	it safe, forever lifted up and anchored sure. Its perfect purity does not
	depend on whether it is seen on earth or not. The sky embraces it, and softly
	holds it in its perfect place, which is as far from earth as earth from
	Heaven. It is not the distance nor the time which keeps this star invisible to
	earth. But those who seek for idols cannot know this star is there.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond all idols is the Thought God holds of you. Completely unaffected by the
	turmoil and the terror of the world; the dreams of birth and death that here
	are dreamed; the myriad of forms that fear can take; quite undisturbed, the
	Thought God holds of you remains exactly as it always was. Surrounded by a
	stillness so complete no sound of battle comes remotely near, it rests in
	certainty and perfect peace. Here is your one reality kept safe, completely
	unaware of all the world that worships idols, and that knows not God. In
	perfect sureness of its changelessness, and of its rest in its eternal home,
	the Thought God holds of you has never left the Mind of its Creator, Whom it
	knows as its Creator knows that it is there.
</p>

<p>
	Where could the Thought God holds of you exist but where <em>you</em> are? Is
	your reality a thing apart from you, and in a world which your reality knows
	nothing of? Outside you, there is no eternal sky, no changeless star, and no
	reality. The Mind of Heaven’s Son in Heaven is, for there the Mind of Father
	and of Son joined in creation which can have no end. You have not two
	realities, but one. Nor can you be <em>aware</em> of more than one. An idol
	<em>or</em> the Thought God holds of you is your reality. Forget not, then,
	that idols must keep hidden what you are, not from the Mind of God, but from
	your own. The star shines still; the sky has never changed. But you, the holy
	Son of God Himself, are unaware of your reality.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">
	E. The Truth Behind Illusions
</h2>

<p>
	You <em>will</em> attack what does not satisfy, and thus you will not see you
	made it up. You <em>always</em> fight illusions. For the truth behind them is
	so lovely and so still in loving gentleness, were you aware of it you would
	forget defensiveness entirely, and rush to its embrace. The truth could never
	be attacked. And this you knew when you made idols. They were made that this
	might be forgotten. You attack but false ideas, and never truthful ones. All
	idols are the false ideas you made to fill the gap you think arose between
	yourself and what is true. And you attack them for the things you think they
	represent. What lies beyond them cannot <em>be</em> attacked.
</p>

<p>
	The wearying, dissatisfying gods you made are blown-up children’s toys. A
	child is frightened when a wooden head springs up as a closed box is opened
	suddenly, or when a soft and silent woolly bear begins to squeak as he takes
	hold of it. The rules he made for boxes and for bears have failed him, and
	have broken his ‘control’ of what surrounds him. And he is afraid because he
	thought the rules protected him. Now must he learn the boxes and the bears did
	not deceive him, broke no rules, nor mean his world is made chaotic and
	unsafe. <em>He</em> was mistaken. He misunderstood what made him safe, and
	thought that it had left.
</p>

<p>
	The gap that is not there is filled with toys in countless forms. And each one
	seems to break the rules you set for it. It never <em>was</em> the thing you
	thought. It must appear to break your rules for safety, since the rules were
	wrong. But <em>you</em> are not endangered. You can laugh at popping heads and
	squeaking toys, as does the child who learns they are no threat to him. Yet
	while he likes to play with them, he still perceives them as obeying rules he
	made for his enjoyment. So there still are rules which they can seem to break,
	and frighten him. Yet <em>is</em> he at the mercy of his toys? And
	<em>can</em> they represent a threat to him?
</p>

<p>
	Reality observes the laws of God, and not the rules you set. It is His laws
	which guarantee your safety. All illusions that you believe about yourself
	obey <em>no</em> laws. They seem to dance a little while, according to the
	rules you set for them. But then they fall, and cannot rise again. They are
	but toys, my children. Do not grieve for them. Their dancing never brought you
	joy. But neither were they things to frighten you, nor make you safe if they
	obeyed your rules. They must be neither cherished nor attacked, but merely
	looked upon as children’s toys, without a single meaning of their own. See one
	in them, and you will see them all. See none in them, and they will touch you
	not.
</p>

<p>
	Appearances deceive <em>because</em> they are appearances, and not reality.
	Dwell not on them in any form. They but obscure reality, and they bring fear
	<em>because</em> they hide the truth. Do not attack what you have made to
	<em>let</em> you be deceived, for thus you prove that you <em>have</em> been
	deceived. Attack <em>has</em> power to make illusions real. Yet what it makes
	is nothing. Who could be made fearful by a power that can have no real effects
	at all? What could it be but an illusion, making things appear like to itself?
	Look calmly at its toys, and understand that they are idols which but dance to
	vain desires. Give them not your worship, for they are not there. Yet this is
	equally forgotten in attack. God’s Son needs no defence against his dreams.
	His idols do not threaten him at all. His one mistake is that he thinks them
	real. What can the power of illusions <em>do</em>?
</p>

<p>
	Appearances can but deceive the mind that <em>wants</em> to be deceived. And
	you can make a simple choice that will forever place you far beyond deception.
	You need not concern yourself with how this will be done, for this you cannot
	understand. But you <em>will</em> understand that mighty changes have been
	quickly brought about, when you decide one very simple thing: you do not
	<em>want</em> whatever you believe an idol gives. For thus the Son of God
	declares that he is free of idols. And thus <em>is</em> he free.
</p>

<p>
	Salvation is a paradox indeed! What could it be except a happy dream? It asks
	you but that you forgive all things that no one ever did; to overlook what is
	not there; and not to look upon the unreal as reality. You are but asked to
	let your will be done, and seek no longer for the things you do not want. And
	you are asked to let yourself be free of all the dreams of what you never
	were, and seek no more to substitute the strength of idle wishes for the Will
	of God.
</p>

<p>
	Here does the dream of separation start to fade and disappear. For here the
	gap that is not there begins to be perceived without the toys of terror that
	you made. No more than this is asked. Be glad indeed salvation asks so little,
	not so much. It asks for <em>nothing</em> in reality. And even in illusions it
	but asks forgiveness be the substitute for fear. Such is the only rule for
	happy dreams. The gap is emptied of the toys of fear, and then its unreality
	is plain. Dreams are for <em>nothing</em>. And the Son of God can have no need
	of them. They offer him no single thing that he could ever want. He is
	delivered from illusions by his will, and but restored to what he is. What
	could God’s plan for his salvation be, except a means to give him to Himself?
</p>

<h2 id="s6">
	F. The Only Purpose
</h2>

<p>
	The real world is the state of mind in which the only purpose of the world is
	seen to be forgiveness. Fear is not its goal, and the <em>escape</em> from
	guilt becomes its aim. The value of forgiveness is perceived, and takes the
	place of idols, which are sought no longer, for their ‘gifts’ are not held
	dear. No rules are idly set, and no demands are made of anyone or anything to
	twist and fit into the dream of fear. Instead, there is a wish to understand
	all things created as they really are. And it is recognised that all things
	must be first forgiven, and <em>then</em> understood.
</p>

<p>
	Here, it is thought that understanding is <em>acquired</em> by attack. There,
	it is clear that by attack is understanding <em>lost</em>. The folly of
	pursuing guilt as goal is fully recognised. And idols are not wanted there,
	for guilt is understood as the sole cause of pain in any form. No one is
	tempted by its vain appeal, for suffering and death have been perceived as
	things not wanted, and not striven for. The possibility of freedom has been
	grasped and welcomed, and the means by which it can be gained can now be
	understood. The world becomes a place of hope, because its only purpose is to
	be a place where hope of happiness can be fulfilled. And no one stands outside
	this hope, because the world has been united in belief the purpose of the
	world is one which all must share, if hope be more than just a dream.
</p>

<p>
	Not yet is Heaven quite remembered, for the purpose of forgiveness still
	remains. Yet everyone is certain he will go beyond forgiveness, and he but
	remains until it is made perfect in himself. He has no wish for anything but
	this. And fear has dropped away, because he is united in his purpose with
	himself. There is a hope of happiness in him so sure and constant he can
	barely stay, and wait a little longer with his feet still touching earth. Yet
	is he glad to wait until every hand is joined, and every heart made ready to
	arise and go with him. For thus is <em>he</em> made ready for the step in
	which is all forgiveness left behind.
</p>

<p>
	The final step is God’s, because it is but God Who could create a perfect Son,
	and share His Fatherhood with him. No one outside of Heaven knows how this can
	be, for understanding this is Heaven itself. Even the real world has a purpose
	still beneath creation and eternity. But fear is gone, because its purpose is
	forgiveness, not idolatry. And so is Heaven’s Son prepared to be Himself, and
	to remember that the Son of God knows everything his Father understands, and
	understands it perfectly with Him.
</p>

<p>
	The real world still falls short of this, for this is God’s Own purpose; only
	His, and yet completely shared and perfectly fulfilled. The real world is a
	state in which the mind has learned how easily do idols go when they are still
	perceived, but wanted not. How willingly the mind can let them go when it has
	understood that idols are nothing and nowhere, and are purposeless. For only
	then can guilt and sin be seen without a purpose, and as meaningless.
</p>

<p>
	Thus is the real world’s purpose gently brought into awareness, to replace the
	goal of sin and guilt. And all that stood between your image of yourself and
	what you are, forgiveness washes joyfully away. Yet God need not create His
	Son again, that what is his be given back to him. The gap between your brother
	and yourself was never <em>there</em>. And what the Son of God knew in
	creation he must know again.
</p>

<p>
	When brothers join in purpose in the world of fear, they stand already at the
	edge of the real world. Perhaps they still look back, and think they see an
	idol that they want. Yet has their path been surely set away from idols toward
	reality. For when they joined their hands, it was Christ’s hand they took, and
	they will look on Him Whose hand they hold. The face of Christ is looked upon
	before the Father is remembered. For He must be unremembered until His Son has
	reached beyond forgiveness, to the love of God. Yet is the love of Christ
	accepted first. And then will come the knowledge They are One.
</p>

<p>
	How light and easy is the step across the narrow boundaries of the world of
	fear, when you have recognised Whose hand you hold! Within your hand is
	everything you need to walk with perfect confidence away from fear forever,
	and to go straight on, and quickly reach the gate of Heaven itself. For He
	Whose hand you hold was waiting but for you to join Him. Now that you have
	come, would <em>he</em> delay in showing you the way that He must walk with
	you? His blessing lies on you as surely as His Father’s love rests upon Him.
	His gratitude to you is past your understanding, for you have enabled Him to
	rise from chains, and go with you, together, to His Father’s house.
</p>

<p>
	An ancient hate is passing from the world. And with it goes all hatred and all
	fear. Look back no longer, for what lies ahead is all you ever wanted in your
	hearts. Give up the world! But not to sacrifice. You never <em>wanted</em> it.
	What happiness have you sought here that did not bring you pain? What moment
	of content has not been bought at fearful price in coins of suffering? Joy
	<em>has</em> no cost. It is your sacred right, and what you pay for is not
	happiness. Be speeded on your way by honesty, and let not your experiences
	here deceive in retrospect. They were not free from bitter cost and joyless
	consequence.
</p>

<p>
	Do not look back except in honesty. And when an idol tempts you, think of
	this:
</p>

<blockquote>
	There never was a time an idol brought<br />
	You anything except the ‘gift’ of guilt.<br />
	Not one was bought except at cost of pain,<br />
	Nor was it ever paid by you alone.
</blockquote>

<p>
	Be merciful unto your brother, then. And do not choose an idol thoughtlessly,
	remembering that he will pay the cost as well as you. For he will be delayed
	when you look back, and you will not perceive Whose loving hand you hold. Look
	forward, then, and walk in confidence, with happy hearts that beat in hope and
	do not pound in fear.
</p>

<p>
	The Will of God forever lies in those whose hands are joined. Until they
	joined, they thought He was their enemy. But when they joined and shared a
	purpose, they were free to learn their will is one. And thus the Will of God
	must reach to their awareness. Nor can they forget for long that It is but
	their own.
</p>

<h2 id="s7">
	G. The Justification for Forgiveness
</h2>

<p>
	Anger is <em>never</em> justified. Attack has <em>no</em> foundation. It is
	here escape from fear begins, and will be made complete. Here is the real
	world given in exchange for dreams of terror. For it is on this forgiveness
	rests, and is but natural. You are not asked to offer pardon where attack is
	due, and would be justified. For this would mean that you forgive a sin by
	overlooking what is really there. This is not pardon. For it would assume
	that, by responding in a way which is not justified, your pardon will become
	the answer to attack that has been made. And thus is pardon inappropriate, by
	being granted where it is not due.
</p>

<p>
	Pardon is <em>always</em> justified. It has a <em>sure</em> foundation. You do
	not forgive the unforgivable, nor overlook a real attack that calls for
	punishment. Salvation does not lie in being asked to make unnatural responses
	which are inappropriate to what is real. Instead, it merely asks that you
	respond appropriately to what is not real by not perceiving what has not
	occurred. If pardon were unjustified, you would be asked to sacrifice your
	rights when you return forgiveness for attack. But you are merely asked to see
	forgiveness as the natural reäction to distress which rests on error, and thus
	calls for help. Forgiveness is the <em>only</em> sane response. It
	<em>keeps</em> your rights from being sacrificed.
</p>

<p>
	This understanding is the only change that lets the real world rise to take
	the place of dreams of terror. Fear cannot arise unless attack is justified,
	and if it had a real foundation, pardon would have none. The real world is
	achieved when you perceive the basis of forgiveness is quite real and fully
	justified. While you regard it as a gift unwarranted, it must <em>uphold</em>
	the guilt you would ‘forgive’. Unjustified forgiveness <em>is</em> attack. And
	this is all the world can ever give. It pardons ‘sinners’ sometimes, but
	remains aware that they have sinned. And so they do not merit the forgiveness
	that it gives.
</p>

<p>
	This is the false forgiveness which the world employs to <em>keep</em> the
	sense of sin alive. And recognising God is just, it seems impossible His
	pardon could be real. Thus is the fear of God the sure result of seeing pardon
	as unmerited. No one who sees himself as guilty can avoid the fear of God. But
	he is saved from this dilemma if he can forgive. The mind must think of its
	Creator as it looks upon itself. If you can see your brother merits pardon,
	you have learned forgiveness is your right as much as his. Nor will you think
	that God intends for you a fearful judgement which your brother does not
	merit. For it is the truth that you can merit neither more nor less than he.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness recognised as merited will heal. It gives the miracle its strength
	to overlook illusions. This is how you learn that you must be forgiven, too.
	There can be no appearance that can <em>not</em> be overlooked. For if there
	were, it would be necessary first there be some sin which stands beyond
	forgiveness. There would be an error that is more than a mistake; a special
	form of error which remains unchangeable, eternal, beyond correction or
	escape. There would be one mistake which had the power to undo creation, and
	to make a world which could replace it, and destroy the Will of God. Only if
	this were possible could there be some appearances which could withstand the
	miracle, and not be healed by it.
</p>

<p>
	There is no surer proof idolatry is what you wish than a belief there are some
	forms of sickness and of joylessness forgiveness cannot heal. This means that
	you prefer to keep some idols, and are not prepared, as yet, to let all idols
	go. And thus you think that some appearances are real, and not appearances at
	all. Be not deceived about the meaning of a fixed belief that some appearances
	are harder to look past than others are. It <em>always</em> means you think
	forgiveness must be limited. And you have set a goal of partial pardon and a
	limited escape from guilt for <em>you</em>. What can this be except a false
	forgiveness of yourself, and everyone who seems apart from you?
</p>

<p>
	It must be true the miracle can heal <em>all</em> forms of sickness, or it
	cannot heal. Its purpose cannot be to judge which forms are real, and which
	appearances are true. If one appearance must remain apart from healing, one
	illusion must be part of truth. And you could not escape all guilt, but only
	some of it. You must forgive God’s Son <em>entirely</em>. Or you will keep an
	image of yourself that is not whole, and will remain afraid to look within,
	and find escape from every idol there. Salvation rests on faith there
	<em>cannot</em> be some forms of guilt which you cannot forgive. And so there
	cannot be appearances which have replaced the truth about God’s Son.
</p>

<p>
	Look on your brother with the willingness to see him as he is. And do not keep
	a part of him outside your willingness that he be healed. To heal is to make
	whole. And what is whole can have no missing parts that have been kept
	outside. Forgiveness rests on recognising this, and being glad there cannot be
	some forms of sickness which the miracle must lack the power to heal.
</p>

<p>
	God’s Son is perfect, or he cannot <em>be</em> God’s Son. Nor will you know
	him, if you think he does not merit the escape from guilt in <em>all</em> its
	forms and <em>all</em> its consequence. There is no way to think of him but
	this, if you would know the truth about yourself:
</p>

<blockquote>
	“I thank You, Father, for Your perfect Son,<br />
	And in his glory will I see my own.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	Here is the joyful statement that there are no forms of evil which can
	overcome the Will of God; the glad acknowledgment that guilt has not succeeded
	by your wish to make illusions real. And what is this except a simple
	statement of the truth?
</p>

<p>
	Look on your brother with this hope in you, and you will understand he could
	not make an error that could change the truth in him. It is not difficult to
	overlook mistakes that have been given no effects. But what you see as having
	power to make an idol of the Son of God you will <em>not</em> pardon. For he
	has become to you a graven image, and a sign of death. Is <em>this</em> your
	Saviour? Is his Father wrong about His Son? Or have <em>you</em> been deceived
	in him who has been given you to heal, for <em>your</em> salvation and
	deliverance?
</p>

<h2 id="s8">
	H. The New Interpretation
</h2>

<p>
	Would God have left the meaning of the world to your interpretation? If He
	had, it <em>has</em> no meaning. For it cannot be that meaning changes
	constantly, and yet is true. The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as with one
	purpose, changelessly established. And no situation can affect its aim, but
	must be in accord with it. For only if its aim could change with every
	situation could each one be open to interpretation which is different every
	time you think of it. You add an element into the script you write for every
	minute in the day, and all that happens now means something else. You take
	away another element, and every meaning shifts accordingly.
</p>

<p>
	What do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day
	<em>should</em> be? And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat,
	and gain and loss. These judgements all are made according to the roles the
	script assigns. The fact they have no meaning in themselves is demonstrated by
	the ease with which these labels change with other judgements, made on
	different aspects of experience. And then, in looking back, you think you see
	another meaning in what went before. What have you really done, except to show
	there <em>was</em> no meaning there? But you assigned a meaning in the light
	of goals that change, with every meaning shifting as they change.
</p>

<p>
	Only a constant purpose can endow events with stable meaning. But it must
	accord <em>one</em> meaning to them all. If they are given different meanings,
	it must be that they reflect but different purposes. And this is all the
	meaning that they have. Can this <em>be</em> meaning? Can confusion be what
	meaning means? Perception cannot be in constant flux, and make allowance for
	stability of meaning anywhere. Fear is a judgement never justified. Its
	presence has no meaning but to show you wrote a fearful script, and are afraid
	accordingly. But not because the thing you fear has fearful meaning in itself.
</p>

<p>
	A common <em>purpose</em> is the only means whereby perception can be
	stabilised, and one interpretation given to the world and all experiences
	here. In this shared purpose is one judgement shared by everyone and
	everything you see. You do not have to judge, for you have learned one meaning
	has been given everything, and you are glad to see it everywhere. It cannot
	change <em>because</em> you would perceive it everywhere, unchanged by
	circumstance. And so you <em>offer</em> it to all events, and let them offer
	you stability.
</p>

<p>
	Escape from judgement simply lies in this: all things have but one purpose,
	which you share with all the world. And nothing in the world can be opposed to
	it, for it belongs to everything as it belongs to you. In single purpose is
	the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which must assume a different purpose for
	the one who gains and him who loses. There could be no thought of sacrifice
	apart from this idea. And it is this idea of different goals which makes
	perception shift and meaning change. In one, united goal does this become
	impossible, for your agreement makes interpretation stabilise and last.
</p>

<p>
	How can communication really be established while the symbols which are used
	mean different things? The Holy Spirit’s goal gives one interpretation,
	meaningful to you and to your brother. Thus can you communicate with him, and
	he with you. In symbols which you both can understand, the sacrifice of
	meaning is undone. All sacrifice entails the loss of your ability to see
	relationships among events. And looked at separately, they <em>have</em> no
	meaning. For there is no light by which they can be seen and understood. They
	have no purpose. And what they are for cannot be seen. In any thought of loss,
	there <em>is</em> no meaning. No one has agreed with you on what it means. It
	is a part of a distorted script, which cannot be interpreted with meaning. It
	must be forever unintelligible. This is not communication. Your dark dreams
	are but the senseless, isolated scripts you write in sleep. Look not to
	separate dreams for meaning. Only dreams of pardon can be shared. They mean
	the same to both of you.
</p>

<p>
	Do not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing. It will
	shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the world is an uncertain
	place, in which you walk in danger and uncertainty. It is but your
	<em>interpretations</em> which are lacking in stability, for they are not in
	line with what you really are. This is a state so seemingly unsafe that fear
	<em>must</em> rise. Do not continue thus, my brothers. We have <em>one</em>
	Interpreter. And through His use of symbols are we joined, so that they mean
	the same to all of us. Our common language lets us speak to all our brothers,
	and to understand with them forgiveness has been given to us all, and thus we
	can communicate again.
</p>

<h2 id="s9">
	I. Changeless Reality
</h2>

<p>
	Appearances deceive, but can be changed. Reality is changeless. It does not
	deceive at all, and if you fail to see beyond appearances you <em>are</em>
	deceived. For everything you see will change, and yet you thought it real
	before, and now you think it real again. Reality is thus reduced to form, and
	capable of change. Reality is changeless. It is this that makes it real, and
	keeps it separate from <em>all</em> appearances. It must transcend all form to
	be itself. It <em>cannot</em> change.
</p>

<p>
	The miracle is means to demonstrate that all appearances can change because
	they <em>are</em> appearances, and cannot have the changelessness reality
	entails. The miracle attests salvation from appearances by <em>showing</em>
	they can change. Your brother has a changelessness in him beyond appearance
	and deception, both. It is obscured by changing views of him which you
	<em>perceive</em> as his reality. The happy dream about him takes the form of
	the appearance of his perfect health, his perfect freedom from all forms of
	lack, and safety from disaster of all kinds. The miracle is proof he is not
	bound by loss or suffering in any form, because it can so easily be
	<em>changed</em>. This demonstrates that it was <em>never</em> real, and could
	not stem from his reality. For that is changeless, and has no effects which
	anything in Heaven or on earth could ever alter. But appearances are shown to
	be unreal <em>because</em> they change.
</p>

<p>
	What is temptation but a wish to make illusions real? It does not seem to be
	the wish that no reality be so. Yet it is an assertion that some forms of
	idols have a powerful appeal which makes them harder to resist than those you
	would not <em>want</em> to have reality. Temptation, then, is nothing more
	than this: a prayer the miracle touch not some dreams, but keep their
	unreality obscure, and give to them reality instead. And Heaven gives no
	answer to the prayer, nor can a miracle be given you to heal appearances you
	do not like. You have established <em>limits</em>. What you ask <em>is</em>
	given you, but not of God Who knows no limits. You have limited
	<em>yourself</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is changeless. Miracles but show what you have interposed between
	reality and your awareness is unreal, and does not interfere at all. The cost
	of the belief there must be some appearances beyond the hope of change is that
	the miracle cannot come forth from you consistently. For you have
	<em>asked</em> it be withheld from power to heal all dreams. There is no
	miracle you cannot have when you <em>desire</em> healing. But there is no
	miracle that can be given you <em>unless</em> you want it. Choose what you
	would heal, and He Who gives all miracles has not been given freedom to bestow
	His gifts upon God’s Son. When he is tempted, he denies reality. And he
	becomes the willing slave of what he chose instead.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Because</em> reality is changeless is a miracle already there to heal all
	things that change, and offer them to you to see in happy form, devoid of
	fear. It will be given you to look upon your brother thus. But not while you
	would have it otherwise in some respects. For this but means you would not
	have him healed and whole. The Christ in him is perfect. Is it this that you
	would look upon? Then let there be no dreams about him which you would prefer
	to seeing this. And you will see the Christ in him because you <em>let</em>
	Him come to you. And when He has appeared to you, you will be certain you are
	like Him, for He is the changeless in your brother <em>and</em> in you.
</p>

<p>
	This will you look upon when you decide there is not one appearance you would
	hold in place of what your brother really is. Let no temptation to prefer a
	dream allow uncertainty to enter here. Be not made guilty and afraid when you
	are tempted by a dream of what he is. But do not give it power to replace the
	changeless in him in your sight of him. There is no false appearance but will
	fade, if you request a miracle instead. There is no pain from which he is not
	free, if you would have him be but what he is. Why should you fear to see the
	Christ in him? You but behold <em>yourself</em> in what you see. As he is
	healed are you made free of guilt, for his appearance <em>is</em> your own to
	you.
</p>
