<h2 id="s1">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The miracle does nothing. All it does is to <em>undo</em>. And thus it cancels
out the interference to what has been done. It does not add, but merely takes
away. And what it takes away is long since gone, but being kept in memory,
appears to have immediate effects. This world was over long ago. The thoughts
that made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them and loved them for
a little while. The miracle but shows the past is gone, and what has truly
gone has no effects. Remembering a cause can but produce illusions of its
presence, not effects.
</p>

<p>
All the effects of guilt are here no more. For guilt is over. In its passing
went its consequences, left without a cause. Why would you cling to it in
memory if you did not <em>desire</em> its effects? Remembering is as selective
as perception, being its past tense. It is perception of the past as if it
were occurring now and still were there to see. Memory, like perception, is a
skill made up by you, to take the place of what God gave in your creation. And
like all the things you made, it can be used to serve another purpose, and to
be the means for something else. It can be used to heal and not to hurt, if
you so wish it be.
</p>

<p>
Nothing employed for healing represents an effort to do anything at all. It is
a recognition that you have no needs which mean that something must be done.
It is an unselective memory, which is not used to interfere with truth. All
things the Holy Spirit can employ for healing have been given Him, without the
content and the purposes for which they have been made. They are but skills
without an application. They <em>await</em> their use. They have no dedication
and no aim.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">
B. The Present Memory
</h2>

<p>
The Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Himself is there. Yet
this is not a memory of past events, but only of a present state. You are so
long accustomed to believe that memory holds only what is past, that it is
hard for you to realise it is a skill that can remember <em>now</em>. The
limitations on remembering the world imposes on it are as vast as those you
let the world impose on you. There <em>is</em> no link of memory to the past.
If you would have it there, then there it is. But only your <em>desire</em>
made the link, and only you have held it to a part of time where guilt appears
to linger still.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit’s use of memory is quite apart from time. He does not seek to
use it as a means to keep the past, but rather as a way to let it <em>go</em>.
Memory holds the message it receives, and does what it is given to do. It does
not write the message, nor appoint what it is for. Like to the body, it is
purposeless within itself. And if it seems to serve to cherish ancient hate,
and offers you the pictures of injustices and hurts which you were saving,
this is what you asked its message be, and this is what it is. Committed to
its vaults, the history of all the body’s past is hidden there. All of the
strange associations made to keep the past alive, the present dead, are stored
within it, waiting your command that they be brought to you, and lived again.
And thus do their effects appear to be increased by time, which took away
their cause.
</p>

<p>
Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing. It works hand in hand with
all the other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed the truth about
yourself. Time neither takes away nor can restore. And yet you make strange
use of it, as if the past had caused the present, which is but a consequence
in which no change can be made possible, because its cause has gone. Yet
change must have a cause that will endure, or else it will not last. No change
can be made in the present, if its cause is past. Only the past is held in
memory as you make use of it, and so it is a way to hold the past
<em>against</em> the now.
</p>

<p>
Remember <em>nothing</em> that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught.
And who would keep a senseless lesson in his mind, when he can learn and can
preserve a better one? When ancient memories of hate appear, remember that
their cause is gone. And so you cannot understand what they are for. Let not
the cause that you would give them now be what it was which made them what
they were, or seemed to be. Be glad that it is gone, for this is what you
would be pardoned from. And see, instead, the new Effects of Cause accepted
<em>now</em>, with consequences <em>here</em>. They will surprise you with
their loveliness. The ancient new ideas they bring will be the happy
consequences of a Cause so ancient that it far exceeds the span of memory
which your perception sees.
</p>

<p>
This is the Cause the Holy Spirit has remembered for you, when you would
forget. It is not past because He let It not be unremembered. It has never
changed because there never was a time in which He did not keep It safely in
your mind. Its consequences will indeed seem new, because you thought that you
remembered not their Cause. Yet was It never absent from your mind, for it was
not your Father’s Will that He be unremembered by His Son.
</p>

<p>
What <em>you</em> remember never was. It came from causelessness which you
confused with cause. It can deserve but laughter, when you learn you have
remembered consequences which were causeless, and could <em>never</em> be
effects. The miracle reminds you of a Cause forever present, perfectly
untouched by time and interference. Never changed from what It <em>is</em>.
And <em>you</em> are its effects, as changeless and as perfect as Itself. Its
memory does not lie in the past, nor awaits the future. It is not revealed in
miracles. They but remind you that It has not gone. When you forgive It for
your sins, It will no longer be denied.
</p>

<p>
You who have sought to lay a judgement on your own Creator cannot understand
it is not He Who laid a judgement on His Son. You would deny Him His effects,
yet have they never been denied. There was no time in which His Son could be
condemned for what was causeless, and against His Will. What your remembering
would witness to is but the fear of God. He has not done the thing you fear.
No more have you. And so your innocence has not been lost. You need no healing
to be healed. In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to
have Its <em>own</em> effects, and doing nothing that would interfere.
</p>

<p>
The miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant, and is still.
It reaches gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it healed in quiet
then, to other minds to share its quietness. And they will join in doing
nothing to prevent its radiant extension back into the Mind Which caused all
minds to be. Born out of sharing, there can be no pause in time to cause the
miracle delay in hastening to all unquiet minds, and bringing them an
instant’s stillness, when the memory of God returns to them. Their own
remembering is quiet now, and what has come to take its place will not be
wholly unremembered afterwards.
</p>

<p>
He to Whom time is given offers thanks for every quiet instant given Him. For
in that instant is His memory allowed to offer all its treasures to the Son of
God, for whom they have been kept. How gladly does He offer them unto the one
for whom He has been given them! And His Creator shares His thanks, because He
would not be deprived of His effects. The instant’s silence that His Son
accepts gives welcome to eternity and Him, and lets Them enter where They
would abide. For in that instant does the Son of God do nothing that would
make himself afraid.
</p>

<p>
How instantly the memory of God arises in the mind that has no fear to keep
the memory away. Its own remembering has gone. There is no past to keep its
fearful image in the way of glad awakening to present peace. The trumpets of
eternity resound throughout the stillness, yet disturb it not. And what is now
remembered is not fear, but, rather, is the cause that fear was made to render
unremembered and undone. The stillness speaks in gentle sounds of love the Son
of God remembers from before his own remembering came in
between the present and the past, to shut them out.
</p>

<p>
Now is the Son of God at last aware of present Cause and Its benign effects.
Now does he understand what he has made is causeless, making no effects at
all. He has done nothing. And in seeing this, he understands he never had a
need for doing anything, and never did. His Cause <em>is</em> Its effects.
There never was a cause beside It that could generate a different past or
future. Its effects are changelessly eternal, beyond fear, and past the world
of sin entirely.
</p>

<p>
What has been lost, to see the causeless not? And where is sacrifice, when
memory of God has come to take the place of loss? What better way to close the
little gap between illusions and reality than to allow the memory of God to
flow across it, making it a bridge an instant will suffice to reach beyond?
For God has closed it with Himself. His memory has not gone by, and left a
stranded Son forever on a shore where he can glimpse another shore which he
can never reach. His Father wills that he be lifted up, and gently carried
over. <em>He</em> has built the bridge, and it is He Who will transport His
Son across it. Have no fear that He will fail in what He wills, nor that you
will be excluded from the Will that is for you.
</p>

<h2 id="s3">
C. Reversing Effect and Cause
</h2>

<p>
Without a cause there can be no effects, and yet without effects there is no
cause. The cause a cause is <em>made</em> by its effects; the Father is a
father by His Son. Effects do not create their cause, but they establish its
causation. Thus, the Son gives fatherhood to his Creator, and receives the
gift that he has given Him. It is <em>because</em> he is God’s Son that he
must also be a father, who creates as God created him. The circle of creation
has no end. Its starting and its ending are the same. But in itself it holds
the universe of all creation, without beginning and without an end.
</p>

<p>Fatherhood <em>is</em> creation. Love must be extended. Purity is not confined. It is the nature of the innocent to be forever uncontained, without a barrier or limitation. Thus is purity not of the body. Nor can it be found where limitation is. The body can be healed by its effects, which are as limitless as is itself. Yet must all healing come about because the mind is recognised as not within the body, and its innocence is quite apart from it, and where <em>all</em> healing is. Where, then, is healing? Only where its cause is given its effects. For sickness is a meaningless attempt to give effects to causelessness, and <em>make</em> it be a cause.</p>

<p>Always in sickness does the Son of God attempt to make himself his cause, and not allow himself to be his Father’s Son. For this impossible desire, he does not believe that he is Love’s effect, and must be cause because of what he is. The cause of healing is the only Cause of everything. It has but <em>one</em> effect. And in that recognition, causelessness is given no effects, and none are seen. A mind within a body, and a world of other bodies, each with separate minds, are your “creations”, you the “other” mind, creating with effects unlike yourself. And as their “father”, you must be like them. Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else’s dream.</p>

<p>
The miracle does not awaken you, but merely shows you who the dreamer
<em>is</em>. It teaches you there is a choice of dreams while you are still
asleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming. Do you wish for dreams of
healing, or for dreams of death? A dream is like a memory in that it pictures
what you <em>wanted</em> shown to you. An empty storehouse, with an open door,
holds all your shreds of memories and dreams. Yet if you are the dreamer, you
perceive this much at least: that <em>you</em> have caused the dream, and can
accept another dream as well. But for this change in content of the dream, it
must be realised that it is you who dreamed the dreaming that you do not like.
It is but an effect which <em>you</em> have caused, and you would not
<em>be</em> cause of this effect.
</p>

<p>
In dreams of murder and attack are you the victim in a dying body slain. But
in forgiving dreams is no one asked to be the victim and the sufferer. These
are the happy dreams the miracle exchanges for your own. It does not ask you
make another; only that you see you made the one you would exchange for this.
This world is causeless, as is every dream that anyone has dreamed within the
world. No plans are possible, and no design exists that could be found and
understood.
</p>

<p>
What else could be expected from a thing that has no cause? Yet if it has no
cause, it has no purpose. You may cause a dream, but never will you give it
real effects. For that would change its cause, and it is this you cannot do.
The dreamer of a dream is not awake, but does not know he sleeps. He sees
illusions of himself as sick or well, depressed or happy, but without a stable
cause with guaranteed effects.
</p>

<p>
The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true.
This is a crucial step in dealing with illusions. No one is afraid of them
when he perceives he made them up. The fear was held in place <em>because</em>
he did not see that he was author of the dream, and not a figure in the dream.
He gives <em>himself</em> the consequences which he dreams he gave his
brother. And it is but this the dream has put together and has offered him, to
show him that his wishes have been done. Thus does he fear his <em>own</em>
attack, but sees it at another’s hands. As victim, he is suffering from its
effects, but not their cause. He authored not his own attack, and he is
innocent of what he caused. The miracle does nothing but to show him that he
has done nothing. What he fears is cause without the consequences which would
<em>make</em> it cause. And so it never was.
</p>

<p>
The separation started with the dream the Father was deprived of His effects,
and powerless to keep them, since He was no longer their Creator. In the
dream, the dreamer made himself, but what he made has turned against him,
taking on the role of its creator, as the dreamer had. And as he hated his
Creator, so the figures in the dream have hated him. His body is their slave,
which they abuse because the motives he has given it have they adopted as
their own. And hate it for the vengeance it would offer them. It is their
vengeance on the body which appears to prove the dreamer could not be the
maker of the dream. Effect and cause are first split off, and then reversed,
so that effect becomes a cause; the cause, effect.
</p>

<p>
This is the separation’s final step, with which salvation, which proceeds to
go the <em>other</em> way, begins. This final step is an effect of what has
gone before, appearing as a cause. The miracle is the first step in giving
back to cause the function of causation, not effect. For this confusion has
produced the dream, and while it lasts, will wakening be feared. Nor will the
call to wakening be heard, because it seems to be the call to fear.
</p>

<p>
Like every lesson which the Holy Spirit requests you learn, the miracle is
clear. It demonstrates what He would have you learn, and shows you its effects
are what you <em>want</em>. In His forgiving dreams are the effects of yours
undone, and hated enemies perceived as friends, with merciful intent. Their
enmity is seen as causeless now, because they did not make it. And you can
accept the role of maker of their hate because you <em>see</em> that it has no
effects. Now are you freed from this much of the dream; the world is neutral,
and the bodies which still seem to move about as separate things need not be
feared. And so they are not sick.
</p>

<p>
The miracle returns the cause of fear to you who made it. But it also shows
that, having no effects it is not cause, because the function of causation is
to have effects. And where effects are gone, there <em>is</em> no cause. Thus
is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind <em>made</em>
sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made. Yet
half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is useless if you learn
but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to
teach. The lesson is the <em>mind</em> was sick that thought the body could be
sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects.
</p>

<p>
This world is full of miracles. They stand in shining silence next to every
dream of pain and suffering, of sin and guilt. They are the dream’s
alternative, the choice to be the dreamer, rather than deny the active role in
making up the dream. They are the glad effects of taking back the consequence
of sickness to its cause. The body is released because the mind acknowledges
“this is not done to me, but I am doing this”. And thus the mind is free to
make another choice instead. Beginning here, salvation will proceed to change
the course of every step in the descent to separation, until all the steps
have been retraced, the ladder gone, and all the dreaming of the world undone.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">
D. The Agreement to Join
</h2>

<p>
What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern. For you
have barely started to allow your first, uncertain steps to be directed up the
ladder separation led you down. The miracle alone is your concern at present.
Here is where we must begin. And having started, will the way be made serene
and simple in the rising up to waking and the ending of the dream. When you
accept a miracle, you do not add your dream of fear to one that is already
being dreamed. Without support, the dream will fade away without effects. For
it is <em>your</em> support that strengthens it.
</p>

<p>
No mind is sick until another mind agrees that they are separate. And thus it
is their <em>joint</em> decision to be sick. If you withhold agreement, and
accept the part <em>you</em> play in making sickness real, the other mind
cannot project its guilt without your aid in letting it perceive itself as
separate and apart from you. Thus is the body not perceived as sick by both
your minds, from separate points of view. Uniting with a brother’s mind
prevents the <em>cause</em> of sickness and perceived effects. Healing is the
effect of minds which join, as sickness comes from minds which separate.
</p>

<p>
The miracle does nothing just <em>because</em> the minds are joined, and
cannot separate. Yet in the dreaming has this been reversed, and separate
minds are seen as bodies, which are separated and which cannot join. Do not
allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have you abandoned him to his own
dream by sharing it with him. He has not seen the cause of sickness where it
is, and you have overlooked the gap between you, where the sickness has been
bred. Thus are you <em>joined</em> in sickness, to preserve the little gap
unhealed, where sickness is kept carefully protected, cherished, and upheld by
firm belief, lest God should come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him.
Fight not His coming with illusions, for it is His coming that you want above
all things that seem to glisten in the dream.
</p>

<p>
The end of dreaming is the end of fear, and love was never in the world of
dreams. The gap <em>is</em> little. Yet it holds the seeds of pestilence and
every form of ill, because it is a wish to keep apart, and not to join. And
thus it seems to give a cause to sickness which is <em>not</em> its cause. The
<em>purpose</em> of the gap is all the cause that sickness has. For it was
made to keep you separated, in a body which you see as if <em>it</em> were the
cause of pain.
</p>

<p>
The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its effect. Yet
separation is but empty space, enclosing nothing, doing nothing, and as
insubstantial as the empty place between the ripples that a ship has made in
passing by. And covered just as fast, as water rushes in to close the gap, and
as the waves, in joining, cover it. Where is the gap between the waves when
they have joined, and covered up the space which seemed to keep them separate
for a little while? Where are the grounds for sickness when the minds have
joined to close the little gap between them, where the seeds of sickness
seemed to grow?
</p>

<p>
God builds the bridge, but only in the space left clean and vacant by the
miracle. The seeds of sickness and the shame of guilt He cannot bridge, for He
cannot destroy the alien will that He created not. Let its effects be gone,
and clutch them not with eager hands, to keep them for yourself. The miracle
will brush them all aside, and thus make room for Him Who wills to come, and
bridge His Son’s returning to Himself.
</p>

<p>
Count, then, the silver miracles and golden dreams of happiness as all the
treasures you would keep within the storehouse of the world. The door is open,
not to thieves, but to your starving brothers, who mistook for gold the
shining of a pebble, and who stored a heap of snow that shone like silver.
They have nothing left behind the open door. What is the world except a little
gap perceived to tear eternity apart, and break it into days and months and
years? And what are you who live within the world except a picture of the Son
of God in broken pieces, each concealed within a separate and uncertain bit of
clay?
</p>

<p>
Be not afraid, but let your world be lit by miracles. And where the gap was
seen to stand between you, join your brother there. And sickness will be seen
<em>without</em> a cause. The dream of healing in forgiveness lies, and gently
shows you that you never sinned. The miracle would leave no proof of guilt to
bring you witness to what never was. And in your storehouse it will make a
place of welcome for your Father and your Self. The door is open, that all
those may come who would no longer starve, and would enjoy the feast of plenty
set before them there. And they will meet with your invited Guests the miracle
has asked to come to you.
</p>

<p>
This is a feast unlike indeed to those the dreaming of the world has shown.
For here, the more that anyone receives, the more is left for all the rest to
share. The Guests have brought unlimited supply with Them. And no one is
deprived or can deprive. Here is a feast the Father lays before His Son, and
shares it equally with him. And in Their sharing there can <em>be</em> no gap
in which abundance falters and grows thin. Here can the lean years enter not,
for time waits not upon this feast, which has no end. For Love has set Its
table in the space that seemed to keep your Guests apart from you.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">
E. The Greater Joining
</h2>

<p>
Accepting the Atonement for yourself means not to give support to someone’s
dream of sickness and of death. It means that you share not his wish to
separate, and let him turn illusions on himself. Nor do you wish that they be
turned, instead, on you. Thus have they <em>no</em> effects. And you are free
of dreams of pain because you let him be. Unless you help him, you will suffer
pain with him because that is your wish. And you become a figure in his dream
of pain, as he in yours. So do you both become illusions and without identity.
You could be anyone or anything, depending on whose evil dream you share. You
can be sure of just one thing: that you are evil, for you share in dreams of
fear.
</p>

<p>
There is a way of finding certainty right <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.
Refuse to be a part of fearful dreams whatever form they take, for you
<em>will</em> lose identity in them. You <em>find</em> yourself by not
accepting them as causing you, and giving you effects. You stand apart from
them, but not apart from him who dreams them. Thus you separate the dreamer
from the dream, and join in one, but let the other <em>go</em>. The dream is
but illusion in the mind. And with the mind you <em>would</em> unite, but
<em>never</em> with the dream. It is the dream you fear, and <em>not</em> the
mind. You see them as the same, because you think that <em>you</em> are but a
dream. And what is real and what is but illusion in yourself you do not know,
and cannot tell apart.
</p>

<p>Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream. Share not in his illusion of himself, for your identity depends on his reality. Think, rather, of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, “hero” of the dream, your brother. It is his <em>reality</em> that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood. His body and his dreams but seem to make a little gap, where yours have joined with his.</p>

<p>
And yet, between your minds there <em>is</em> no gap. To join his dreams is
thus to meet him not, because his dreams would separate from you. Therefore,
release him, merely by your claim on brotherhood, and not on dreams of fear.
Let him acknowledge who he is, by not supporting his illusions by your faith,
for if you do, you will have faith in <em>yours</em>. With faith in yours,
<em>he</em> will not be released, and <em>you</em> are kept in bondage to his
dream. And dreams of fear will haunt the little gap, inhabited but by
illusions which you have supported in each other’s minds.
</p>

<p>
Be certain, if you do your part, he will do his, for he will join you where
you stand. Call not to him to meet you in the gap between you, or you must
believe that it is your reality, as well as his. You <em>cannot</em> do his
part, but this you <em>do</em> when you become a passive figure in his dream,
instead of dreamer of your own. Identity in dreams is meaningless because the
dreamer and the dream are one. Who <em>shares</em> a dream must <em>be</em>
the dream he shares, because by sharing is a cause produced.
</p>

<p>
You share confusion, and you <em>are</em> confused, for in the gap no stable
self exists. What is the same seems different, because what is the same
appears to be unlike. His dreams are yours because you <em>let</em> them be.
But if you took your own away would he be free of them, and of his own as
well. Your dreams are witnesses to his, and his attest the truth of yours. Yet
if you see there <em>is</em> no truth in yours, his dreams will go, and he
will understand what <em>made</em> the dream.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit is in <em>both</em> your minds, and He is One because there is
no gap that separates His Oneness from Itself. The gap between your bodies
matters not, for what is joined in Him is <em>always</em> one. No one is sick
if someone else accepts his union with him. His desire to be a sick and
separated mind can not remain without a witness or a cause. And <em>both</em>
are gone if someone wills to be united with him. He has dreams that he was
separated from his brother who, by sharing not his dream, has left the space
between them vacant. And the Father comes to join His Son the Holy Spirit
joined.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit’s function is to take the broken picture of the Son of God,
and put the pieces into place again. This holy picture, healed entirely, does
He hold out to every separate piece that thinks it is a picture in itself. To
each he offers his identity, which the whole picture represents, instead of
just a little, broken bit which he insisted was himself. And when he sees
<em>this</em> picture, he will recognise himself. If you share not your
brother’s evil dream, this <em>is</em> the picture that the miracle will place
within the little gap, left clean of all the seeds of sickness and of sin. And
here the Father will receive His Son, because His Son was gracious to himself.
</p>

<p>
I thank you, Father, knowing you will come to close each little gap that lies
between the broken pieces of Your holy Son. Your holiness, complete and
perfect, lies in every one of them. And they <em>are</em> joined, because what
is in one is in them all. How holy is the smallest grain of sand, when it is
recognised as being part of the completed picture of God’s Son! The forms the
broken pieces seem to take mean nothing. For the whole is in each one. And
every aspect of the Son of God is just the same as every other part.
</p>

<p>Join not your brother’s dreams, but join with <em>him</em>, and where you join His Son, the Father is. Who seeks for substitutes when he perceives he has lost nothing? Who would <em>want</em> to have the “benefits” of sickness when he has received the simple happiness of health? What God has given cannot <em>be</em> a loss, and what is not of Him has no effects. What, then, would you perceive within the gap? The seeds of sickness come from the belief that there is <em>joy</em> in separation, and its giving up would be a <em>sacrifice</em>. But miracles are the result, when you do not insist on seeing in the gap what is not there. Your willingness to <em>let</em> illusions go is all the Healer of God’s Son requires. He will place the miracle of healing where the seeds of sickness were. And there will be <em>no</em> loss, but <em>only</em> gain.</p>

<h2 id="s6">
F. The Alternate to Dreams of Fear
</h2>

<p>
What is a sense of sickness but a sense of limitation? Of a splitting
<em>off</em> and separating <em>from</em>? A gap perceived between yourselves
and what is seen as health? The good is seen outside; the evil, in. And thus
is sickness separating off the self from good, and keeping evil in. God is the
<em>alternate</em> to dreams of fear. Who shares in them can <em>never</em>
share in Him. But who withdraws his mind from sharing them <em>is</em> sharing
Him. There is no other choice. Except you share it, nothing can exist. And
<em>you</em> exist because God shared His Will with you, that His creation
might create.
</p>

<p>
It is the <em>sharing</em> of the evil dreams of hate and malice, bitterness
and death, of sin and suffering and pain and loss, that makes them real.
Unshared, they are perceived as meaningless. The fear is gone from them
because you did not give them your support. Where fear has gone there love
<em>must</em> come, because there <em>are</em> but these alternatives. Where
one appears, the other disappears. And which you share becomes the only one
you have. You have the one which you accept, because it is the only one you
<em>wish</em> to have. You share no evil dreams if you forgive the dreamer,
and perceive that he is not the dream he made. And so he cannot be a part of
yours, from which you <em>both</em> are free. Forgiveness separates the
dreamer from the evil dream, and thus releases him.
</p>

<p>Remember if you share an evil dream, you will believe you <em>are</em> the dream you share. And fearing it, you will not <em>want</em> to know your own identity, because you think that <em>it</em> is fearful. And you <em>will</em> deny your Self, and walk upon an alien ground which your Creator did not make, and where you seem to be a “something” you are not. You <em>will</em> make war upon your Self, which seems to be your enemy; and <em>will</em> attack your brother, as a part of what you hate. There <em>is</em> no compromise. You are your Self or an illusion. What can be between illusion and the truth? A middle ground, where you can be a thing that is not you, must be a dream and cannot be the truth.</p>

<p>
You have conceived a little gap between illusions and the truth to be the
place where all your safety lies, and where your Self is safely hidden by what
you have made. Here is a world established that is sick, and this the world
the body’s eyes perceive. Here are the sounds it hears; the voices which its
ears were made to hear. Yet sights and sounds the body can perceive are
meaningless. It cannot see nor hear. It does not know what seeing <em>is</em>;
what listening is <em>for</em>. It is as little able to perceive as it can
judge or understand or know. Its eyes are blind; its ears are deaf. It cannot
think, and so it cannot have effects.
</p>

<p>
What is there God created to be sick? And what that He created not can be? Let
not your eyes behold a dream; your ears bear witness to illusion. They were
made to look upon a world that is not there; to hear the voices that can make
no sound. Yet are there other sounds and other sights which <em>can</em> be
seen and heard and understood. For eyes and ears are senses without sense, and
what they see and hear they but report. It is not they that hear and see, but
<em>you</em>, who put together every jagged piece, each senseless scrap and
shred of evidence, and make a witness to the world you want. Let not the
body’s ears and eyes perceive these countless fragments seen within the gap
which you imagined, and let them persuade their maker his imaginings are real.
</p>

<p>
Creation proves reality because it shares the function all creation shares. It
is not made of little bits of glass, a piece of wood, a thread or two perhaps,
all put together to attest its truth. Reality does not depend on this. There
<em>is</em> no gap which separates the truth from dreams and from illusions.
Truth has left no room for them in any place or time. For it fills every place
and every time, and makes them wholly indivisible.
</p>

<p>
You who believe there <em>is</em> a little gap between you, do not understand
that it is here that you are kept as prisoners in a world perceived to be
existing here. The world you see does not exist, because the place where you
perceive it is not real. The gap is carefully concealed in fog, and misty
pictures
rise to cover it with vague, uncertain forms and changing shapes, forever
unsubstantial and unsure. Yet in the gap is <em>nothing</em>. And there
<em>are</em> no awesome secrets and no darkened tombs where terror rises from
the bones of death. Look at the little gap, and you behold the innocence and
emptiness of sin that you will see within yourself, when you have lost the
fear of <em>recognising</em> love.
</p>

G. The Secret Vows
</h2>

<p>
Who punishes the body is insane. For here the little gap is seen, and yet it
is not here. It has not judged itself, nor made itself to be what it is not.
It does not seek to make of pain a joy, and look for lasting pleasure in the
dust. It does not tell you what its purpose is, and cannot understand what it
is for. It does not victimise, because it has no will, no preferences, and no
doubts. It does not wonder what it is. And so it has no need to be
competitive. It <em>can</em> be victimised, but <em>cannot</em> feel itself as
victim. It accepts no role, but does what it is told, without attack.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed a senseless point of view to hold responsible for sight a thing
that cannot see, and blame it for the sounds you do not like, although it
cannot hear. It suffers not the punishment you give, because it has no
feeling. It behaves in ways you want, but never makes the choice. It is not
born and does not die. It can but follow aimlessly the path on which it has
been set. And if that path is changed, it walks as easily another way. It
takes no sides, and judges not the road it travels. It perceives no gap,
because it does not hate. It can be <em>used</em> for hate, but it cannot be
hateful made thereby.
</p>

<p>
The thing you hate and fear and loathe and <em>want</em>, the body does not
know. You send it forth to seek for separation and to be a separate thing. And
<em>then</em> you hate it, not for what it is, but for the uses you have made
of it. You shrink from what it sees and what it hears, and hate its frailty
and littleness. And you despise its acts, but not your own. It sees and acts
for <em>you</em>. It hears <em>your</em> voice. And it is frail and little by
<em>your</em> wish. It seems to punish you, and thus deserve your hatred for
the limitations which it brings to you. Yet you have made of it a symbol for
the limitations which you want your <em>mind</em> to have and see and
<em>keep</em>.
</p>

<p>
The body <em>represents</em> the gap between the little bit of mind you call
your own, and all the rest of what is <em>really</em> yours. You hate it, yet
you think it <em>is</em> your self, and that, without it, would your self be
lost. This is the secret vow which you have made with every brother who would
walk apart. This is the secret oath you take again, whenever you perceive
yourself attacked. No one can suffer if he does not see himself attacked, and
<em>losing</em> by attack. Unstated and unheard in consciousness is every
pledge to sickness. Yet it is a promise to another to be hurt by him, and to
attack him in return.
</p>

<p>
Sickness is anger taken out upon the body, so that <em>it</em> will suffer
pain. It is the obvious effect of what was made in secret, in agreement with
another’s secret wish to be apart from you, as you would be apart from him.
Unless you <em>both</em> agree that is your wish, it can have no effects.
Whoëver says, “There <em>is</em> no gap between my mind and yours” has kept
God’s promise, not his tiny oath to be forever faithful unto death. And by his
healing is his brother healed.
</p>

<p>
Let this be your agreement with each one; that you be one with him, and not
apart. And he will keep the promise that you make with him, because it is the
one which he has made to God, as God has made to him. God keeps His promises;
His Son keeps his. In his creation did his Father say, “You are beloved of Me
and I of you forever. Be you perfect as Myself, for you can never be apart
from Me”. His Son remembers not that he replied “I will”, though in that
promise he was born. Yet God reminds him of it every time he does not share a
promise to be sick, but lets his mind be healed and unified. His secret vows
are powerless before the Will of God, Whose promises he shares. And what he
substitutes is not his will, who has made promise of himself to God.
</p>

<h2 id="s8">
H. The Beautiful Relationship
</h2>

<p>
God asks for nothing, and His Son, like Him, need ask for nothing. For there
is no lack in him. An empty space, a little gap, would be a lack. And it is
only there that he could want for something he has not. A space where God is
not, a gap between the Father and the Son is not the Will of either, who have
promised to be One. God’s promise is a promise to <em>Himself</em>, and there
is no one who could be untrue to what He wills as part of what He <em>is</em>.
The promise that there is no gap between Himself and what He is cannot be
false. What will can come between what <em>must</em> be One, and in Whose
wholeness there can <em>be</em> no gap?
</p>

<p>
The beautiful relationship you have with all your brothers is a part of you
because it is a part of God Himself. Are you not sick, if you deny yourself
your wholeness and your health, the Source of help, the Call to healing and
the Call to heal? Your Saviour waits for healing, and the world waits with
him. Nor are you apart from it. For healing will be one or not at all, its
oneness being where the healing lies. What could correct for separation but
its opposite? There is no middle ground in any aspect of salvation. You accept
it wholly or accept it not. What is unseparated must be joined. And what is
joined cannot be separate.
</p>

<p>
Either there is a gap between you and your brother, or you <em>are</em> as
one. There is no in between, no other choice, and no allegiance to be split
between the two. A split allegiance is but faithlessness to both, and merely
sets you spinning around, to grasp uncertainly at any straw that seems to hold
some promise of relief. Yet who can build his home upon a straw, and count on
it as shelter from the wind? The body can be made a home like this, because it
lacks foundation in the truth. And yet, <em>because</em> it does, it can be
seen as <em>not</em> your home, but merely as an aid to help you reach the
home where God abides.
</p>

<p>
With <em>this</em> as purpose <em>is</em> the body healed. It is not used to
witness to the dream of separation and disease. Nor is it idly blamed for what
it did not do. It serves to help the healing of God’s Son, and for
<em>this</em> purpose it cannot <em>be</em> sick. It will not join a purpose
not your own, and you have <em>chosen</em> that it not be sick. All miracles
are based upon this choice, and given you the instant it is made. No forms of
sickness are immune, because the choice cannot be made in terms of form. The
choice of sickness <em>seems</em> to be a form, yet it is one, as is its
opposite. And <em>you</em> are sick or well, accordingly.
</p>

<p>
But never you alone. This world is but the dream that you can <em>be</em>
alone, and think without affecting those apart from you. To be alone must mean
you are apart, and if you are, you cannot <em>but</em> be sick. This seems to
prove that you must be apart. Yet all it means is that you tried to keep a
promise to be true to faithlessness. Yet faithlessness <em>is</em> sickness.
It is like the house set upon straw. It seems to be quite solid and
substantial in itself. Yet its stability cannot be judged apart from its
foundation. If it rests on straw, there is no need to bar the door and lock
the windows, and make fast the bolts. The wind <em>will</em> topple it, and
rain <em>will</em> come and carry it into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
What is the sense in seeking to be safe in what was <em>made</em> for danger
and for fear? Why burden it with further locks and chains and heavy anchors,
when its weakness lies, not in itself, but in the frailty of the little gap of
nothingness whereön it stands? What <em>can</em> be safe which rests upon a
shadow? Would you build your home upon what will collapse beneath a feather’s
weight?
</p>

<p>
Your home is built upon your brother’s health, upon his happiness, his
sinlessness, and everything his Father promised him. No secret promise you
have made instead has shaken the Foundation of his home. The winds will blow
upon it, and the rain will beat against it, but with no effect. The world will
wash away, and yet this house will stand forever, for its strength lies not
within itself alone. It is an ark of safety, resting on God’s promise that His
Son is safe forever in Himself. What gap can interpose itself between the
safety of this shelter and its Source? From here the body can be seen as what
it is, and neither less nor more in worth than the extent to which it can be
used to liberate God’s Son unto his home. And with this holy purpose, is it
made a home of holiness a little while, because it shares your Father’s Will
with You.
