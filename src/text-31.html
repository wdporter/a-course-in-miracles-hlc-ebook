title: 31. The Simplicity of Salvation
permalink: text-31.xhtml

<h2 id="s1">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
How simple is salvation! All it says is what was never true is not true now,
and never will be. The impossible has not occurred, and can have no effects.
And that is all. Can this be hard to learn by anyone who <em>wants</em> it to
be true? Only unwillingness to learn it could make such an easy lesson
difficult. How hard is it to see that what is false can not be true, and what
is true can not be false? You can no longer say that you perceive no
differences in false and true. You have been told exactly how to tell one from
the other, and just what to do if you become confused. Why, then, do you
persist in learning not such simple things?
</p>

<p>
There <em>is</em> a reason. But confuse it not with difficulty in the simple
things salvation asks you learn. It teaches but the very obvious. It merely
goes from one apparent lesson to the next, in easy steps which lead you gently
from one to another, with no strain at all. This cannot be confusing, yet you
<em>are</em> confused. For somehow you believe that what is totally confused
is easier to learn and understand. What you have taught yourselves is such a
giant learning feat it is indeed incredible. But you accomplished it because
you wanted to, and did not pause in diligence to judge it hard to learn, or
too complex to grasp.
</p>

<p>
No one who understands what you have learned, how carefully you learned it,
and the pains to which you went to practice and repeat the lessons endlessly,
in every form you could conceive of them, could ever doubt the power of your
learning skill. There is no greater power in the world. The world was made by
it, and even now depends on nothing else. The lessons you have taught
yourselves have been so overlearned and fixed they rise like heavy curtains to
obscure the simple and the obvious. Say not you cannot learn <em>them</em>.
For your power to learn is strong enough to teach you that your will is not
your own, your thoughts do not belong to you, and even <em>you</em> are
someone else.
</p>

<p>
Who could maintain that lessons such as these are easy? Yet you have learned
more than this. You have continued, taking every step, however difficult,
without complaint, until a world was built that suited you. And every lesson
that makes up the world arises from the first accomplishment of learning; an
enormity so great the Holy Spirit’s Voice seems small and still before its
magnitude. The world began with one strange lesson, powerful enough to render
God forgotten and His Son an alien to himself, in exile from the home where
God Himself established him. You who have taught yourselves the Son of God is
guilty, say not that you cannot learn the simple things salvation teaches you!
</p>

<p>
Learning is an ability you made, and gave yourselves. It was not made to do
the Will of God, but to uphold a wish that It could be opposed, and that a
will apart from It was yet more real than It. And this has learning sought to
demonstrate, and you have learned what it was made to teach. Now does your
ancient overlearning stand implacable before the Voice of truth, and teach you
that Its lessons are not true; too hard to learn, too difficult to see, and
too opposed to what is really true. Yet you <em>will</em> learn them, for
their learning is the only purpose for your learning skill the Holy Spirit
sees in all the world. His simple lessons in forgiveness have a power mightier
than yours, because they call from God and from your Self to you.
</p>

<p>
Is this a <em>little</em> Voice, so small and still It cannot rise above the
senseless noise of sounds which have no meaning? God willed not His Son forget
Him. And the power of His Will is in the Voice that speaks for Him. Which
lesson will you learn? What outcome is inevitable, sure as God, and far beyond
all doubt and question? Can it be your little learning, strange in outcome,
and incredible in difficulty will withstand the simple lessons being taught to
you in every moment of each day, since time began and learning had been made?
</p>

<p>
The lessons to be learned are only two. Each has its outcome in a different
world. And each world follows surely from its source. The certain outcome of
the lesson that God’s Son is guilty is the world you see. It <em>is</em> a
world of terror and despair. Nor is there hope of happiness in it. There is no
plan for safety you can make that ever will succeed. There is no joy that you
can seek for here, and hope to find. Yet this is not the only outcome which
your learning can produce. However much you may have overlearned your chosen
task, the lesson which reflects the love of God is stronger still. And you
<em>will</em> learn God’s Son is innocent, and see another world.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of the lesson that God’s Son is guiltless is a world in which
there is no fear, and everything is lit with hope, and sparkles with a gentle
friendliness. Nothing but calls to you in soft appeal to be your friend, and
let it join with you. And never does a call remain unheard, misunderstood, nor
left unanswered in the self-same tongue in which the call was made. And you
will understand it was this call that everyone and everything within the world
has <em>always</em> made, but you had not perceived it as it was. And now you
see you were mistaken. You had been deceived by forms the call was hidden in.
And so you did not hear it, and had lost a friend who always wanted to be part
of you. The soft, eternal calling of each part of God’s creation to the whole
is heard throughout the world this second lesson brings.
</p>

<p>
There is no living thing which does not share the universal will that it be
whole, and that you do not leave its call unheard. Without your answer is it
left to die, as it is saved from death when you have heard its calling as the
ancient call to life, and understood that it is but your own. The Christ in
you remembers God with all the certainty with which He knows His love. But
only if His Son is innocent can He be Love. For God were fear indeed if he
whom He created innocent could be a slave to guilt. God’s perfect Son
remembers his creation. But in guilt he has forgotten what he really is.
</p>

<p>
The fear of God results as surely from the lesson that His Son is guilty as
God’s love must be remembered when he learns his innocence. For hate must
father fear, and look upon its father as itself. How wrong are you who fail to
hear the call that echoes past each seeming call to death, that sings behind
each murderous attack, and pleads that love restore the dying world! You do
not understand Who calls to you beyond each form of hate, each call to war.
Yet you will recognise Him as you give Him answer in the language that He
calls. He will appear when you have answered Him, and you will know in Him
that God <em>is</em> Love.
</p>

<p>What is temptation but a wish to make the wrong decision on what you would learn, and have an outcome that you do not want? It is the recognition that it is a state of mind unwanted that becomes the means whereby the choice is reässessed; another outcome seen to be preferred. You are deceived if you believe you want disaster and disunity and pain. Hear not the call for this within yourself. But listen, rather, to the deeper call beyond it, that appeals for peace and joy. And all the world will <em>give</em> you joy and peace. For as you hear, you answer. And behold! Your answer is the proof of what you learned. Its outcome is the world you look upon. </p>

<p>
Let us be still an instant, and forget all things we ever learned, all
thoughts we had, and every preconception which we hold of what things mean,
and what their purpose is. Let us remember not our own ideas of what the world
is for. We do not know. Let every image held of everyone be loosened from our
minds and swept away. Be innocent of judgement, unaware of any thoughts of
evil or of good that ever crossed your mind of anyone. Now do we know him not.
But you <em>are</em> free to learn of him, and learn of him anew. Now is he
born again to you, and you are born again to him, without the past that
sentenced him to die, and you with him. Now is he free to live, as you are
free, because an ancient learning passed away, and left a place for truth to
be reborn. </p>

<h2 id="s2">
B. The Illusion of an Enemy
</h2>

<p>
An ancient lesson is not overcome by the opposing of the new and old. It is
not vanquished that the truth be known, nor fought against to lose to truth’s
appeal. There is no battle which must be prepared; no time to be expended, and
no plans that need be laid for bringing in the new. There <em>is</em> an
ancient battle being waged <em>against</em> the truth, but truth does not
respond. Who could be hurt in such a war, unless he hurts himself? He has no
enemy in truth. And can he be assailed by dreams?
</p>

<p>
Let us review again what seems to stand between you and the truth of what you
are. For there are steps in its relinquishment. The first is a decision that
<em>you</em> make. But afterwards, the truth is <em>given</em> you. You would
<em>establish</em> truth. And by your wish, you set two choices to be made
each time you think you must decide on anything. Neither is true. Nor are they
different. Yet must we see them both, before you can look past them, to the
one alternative that <em>is</em> a different choice. But not in dreams you
made, that this might be obscured to you.
</p>

<p>
What <em>you</em> would choose between is not a choice, and gives but the
illusion it is free, for it will have one outcome either way. Thus is it
really not a choice at all. The leader and the follower emerge as separate
roles, each seeming to possess advantages you would not want to lose. So in
their fusion there appears to be the hope of satisfaction and of peace. You
see yourself divided into both these roles, forever split between the two. And
every friend or enemy becomes a means to help you save yourself from this.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you call it love. Perhaps you think that it is murder justified at
last. You hate the one you gave the leader’s role when you would have it, and
you hate as well his not assuming it, at times you want to let the follower in
you arise, and give away the role of leadership. And this is what you made
your brother <em>for</em>, and learned to think that this his purpose
<em>is</em>. Unless he serves it, he has not fulfilled the function that was
given him by you. And thus he merits death, because he has no purpose and no
usefulness to you.
</p>

<p>
And what of him? What does he want of you? What could he want, but what you
want of him? Hereïn is life as easily as death, for what you choose, you
choose as well for him. Two calls you make to him, as he to you. Between
<em>these</em> two <em>is</em> choice, because from them there <em>is</em> a
different
outcome. If he be the leader or the follower to you, it matters not, for you
have chosen death. But if he calls for death or calls for life; for hate or
for forgiveness and for help, is not the same in outcome. Hear the one, and
you are separate from him, and are lost. But hear the other, and you join with
him, and in your answer is salvation found. The voice you hear in him is but
your own. What does he ask you for? And listen well! For he is asking what
will come to you because you see an image of <em>yourself</em>, and hear
<em>your</em> voice requesting what you <em>want</em>.
</p>

<p>
Before you answer, pause to think of this:
</p>

<blockquote>
“The answer that I give my brother is <br />
What I am asking for. And what I learn <br />
Of him is what I learn about myself.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Then let us wait an instant and be still, forgetting everything we thought we
heard; remembering how much we do not know. This brother neither leads nor
follows us, but walks beside us on the self-same road. He is like us, as near
or far away from what we want as we will let him be. We make no gains he does
not make with us, and we fall back if he does not advance. Take not his hand
in anger but in love, for in his progress do you count your own. And we go
separately along the way unless you keep him safely by your side.
</p>

<p>
Because he is your equal in God’s love, you will be saved from all
appearances, and answer to the Christ Who calls to you. Be still and listen.
Think not ancient thoughts. Forget the dismal lessons that you learned about
this Son of God who calls to you. Christ calls to all with equal tenderness,
seeing no leaders and no followers, and hearing but one answer to them all.
Because He hears one Voice, He cannot hear a different answer from the one He
gave when God appointed Him His only Son.
</p>

<p>
Be very still an instant. Come without all thought of what you ever learned
before, and put aside all images you made. The old will fall away before the
new without your opposition or intent. There will be no attack upon the things
you thought were precious, and in need of care. There will be no assault upon
your wish to hear a call that never has been made. Nothing will hurt you in
this holy place, to which you come to listen silently, and learn the truth of
what you really want. No more than this will you be asked to learn. But as you
hear it, you will understand you need but come away without the thoughts you
did not want, and that were never true.
</p>

<p>
Forgive your brother all appearances, which are but ancient lessons that you
taught yourself about the sinfulness in <em>you</em>. Hear but his call for
mercy and release from all the fearful images he holds of what he is, and of
what you must be. He is afraid to walk with you, and thinks perhaps a bit
behind, a bit ahead, would be a safer place for him to be. Can <em>you</em>
make progress if you think the same, advancing only when he would step back,
and falling back when he would go ahead? For so do you forget the journey’s
goal, which is but to decide to walk <em>with</em> him, so neither leads nor
follows. Thus it is a way you go <em>together</em>, not alone. And in this
choice is learning’s outcome changed, for Christ has been reborn to both of
you.
</p>

<p>
An instant spent without your old ideas of who your great Companion is and
what he <em>should</em> be asking for, will be enough to let this happen. And
you will perceive his purpose is the same as yours. He asks for what
<em>you</em> want, and needs the same as <em>you</em>. It takes, perhaps, a
different form in him, but it is not the form you answer to. He asks and you
receive, for you have come with but one purpose; that you both may learn you
love each other with a brother’s love. And as a brother, must his Father be
the same as yours, as he is like yourself.
</p>

<p>
Together is your joint inheritance remembered and accepted by you both. Alone
it is denied to both of you. Is it not clear that while you still insist on
leading or on following, you think you walk alone, with no one by your side?
This is the road to nowhere, for the light cannot be given while you walk
alone, and so you cannot see which way you go. And thus there is confusion,
and a sense of endless doubting, as you stagger back and forward in the
darkness and alone. Yet these are but appearances of what the journey is, and
how it must be made. For next to you is One Who holds the light before you, so
that every step is made in certainty and sureness of the road. A blindfold can
indeed obscure your sight, but cannot make the way itself grow dark. And He
Who travels with you <em>has</em> the light.
</p>

<h2 id="s3">
C. The Self-Accused
</h2>

<p>Only the self-accused condemn. As you prepare to make a choice that will result in different outcomes, there is first one thing that must be overlearned. It must become a habit of response so typical of everything you do that it becomes your first response to all temptation, and to every situation that occurs. Learn this, and learn it well, for it is here delay of happiness is shortened by a span of time you cannot realise. You never hate your brother for his sins, but <em>only</em> for your own. Whatever form his sins appear to take it but obscures the fact that you believe them to be yours, and therefore meriting a “just” attack.</p>

<p>
Why should his sins <em>be</em> sins, if you did not believe they could not be
forgiven in you? Why are they real in him, if you did not believe that they
are your reality? And why do you attack them everywhere except you hate
yourself? Are <em>you</em> a sin? You answer “yes” whenever you attack, for by
attack do you assert that you are guilty, and must give as you deserve. And
what can you deserve but what you <em>are</em>? If you did not believe that
you deserved attack, it never would occur to you to <em>give</em> attack to
anyone at all. Why should you? What would be the gain to you? What could the
outcome be that you would <em>want</em>? And how <em>could</em> murder bring
you benefit?
</p>

<p>
Sins are in bodies. They are not perceived in minds. They are not seen as
purposes, but actions. Bodies act, and minds do not. And therefore must the
body be at fault for what it does. It is not seen to be a passive thing,
obeying your commands, and doing nothing of itself at all. If you are sin you
<em>are</em> a body, for the mind acts not. And purpose must be in the body,
not the mind. The body must act on its own, and motivate itself. If you are
sin, you lock the mind within the body, and you give its purpose to its
prison-house, which acts instead of it. A jailer does not follow orders, but
<em>enforces</em> orders on the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Yet is the <em>body</em> prisoner, and <em>not</em> the mind. The body thinks
no thoughts. It has no power to learn, to pardon, nor enslave. It gives no
orders that the mind need serve, nor sets conditions that it must obey. It
holds in prison but the willing mind that would abide in it. It sickens at the
bidding of the mind that would become its prisoner. And it grows old and dies,
because that mind is sick within itself. Learning is all that causes change.
And so the body, where no learning can occur, could never change unless the
mind preferred the body change in its appearances, to suit the purpose given
by the mind. For it <em>can</em> learn, and <em>there</em> is all change made.
</p>

<p>
The mind that thinks it is a sin has but one purpose: that the body be the
source of sin, and keep it in the prison-house it chose and guards, and holds
itself at bay, a sleeping prisoner to the snarling dogs of hate and evil,
sickness and attack; of pain and age, of grief and suffering. Here are the
thoughts of sacrifice preserved, for here guilt rules, and orders that the
world be like itself; a place where nothing can find mercy, or survive the
ravages of fear except in murder and in death. For here are you made sin, and
sin cannot abide the joyous and the free, for they are enemies which sin must
kill. In death is sin preserved, and those who think that they are sin must
die for what they think they are.
</p>

<p>
Let us be glad that you <em>will</em> see what you believe, and that it has
been given you to <em>change</em> what you believe. The body will but follow.
It can never lead you where you would not be. It does not guard your sleep,
nor interfere with your awakening. Release your body from imprisonment, and
you will see no one as prisoner to what you have escaped. You will not want to
hold in guilt your chosen enemies, nor keep in chains to the illusion of a
changing love the ones you think are friends.
</p>

<p>
The innocent release in gratitude for <em>their</em> release. And what they
see upholds their freedom from imprisonment and death. Open your mind to
change, and there will be no ancient penalty exacted from your brother
<em>or</em> yourself. For God has said there <em>is</em> no sacrifice that can
be asked; there <em>is</em> no sacrifice that can be made.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">
D. The Real Alternative
</h2>

<p>
There is a tendency to think the world can offer consolation and escape from
problems which its purpose is to <em>keep</em>. Why should this be? Because it
is a place where choice among illusions seems to be the <em>only</em> choice.
And you are in control of outcomes of your choosing. Thus you think, within
the narrow band from birth to death, a little time is given you to use for you
alone; a time when everyone conflicts with you, but you can choose which road
will lead you out of conflict, and away from difficulties which concern you
not. Yet they <em>are</em> your concern. How, then, can you escape from them
by leaving them behind? What must go with you, you will take with you whatever
road you choose to walk along.
</p>

<p>
<em>Real</em> choice is no illusion. But the world has none to offer. All its
roads but lead to disappointment, nothingness and death. There <em>is</em> no
choice in its alternatives. Seek not escape from problems here. The world was
made that problems could not <em>be</em> escaped. Be not deceived by all the
different names its roads are given. They have but one end. And each is but
the means to gain that end, for it is here that all its roads will lead,
however differently they seem to start; however differently they seem to go.
Their end is certain, for there is no choice among them. All of them will lead
to death. On some you travel gaily for a while, before the bleakness enters.
And on some the thorns are felt at once. The choice is not <em>what</em> will
the ending be, but <em>when</em> it comes.
</p>

<p>
There is no choice where every end is sure. Perhaps you would prefer to try
them all, before you really learn they are but one. The roads this world can
offer seem to be quite large in number, but the time must come when everyone
begins to see how like they are to one another. Men have died on seeing this,
because they saw no way except the pathways offered by the world. And learning
they led nowhere, lost their hope. And yet this was the time they could have
learned their greatest lesson. All must reach this point, and go beyond it. It
is true indeed there is no choice at all within the world. But this is not the
lesson in itself. The lesson has a purpose, and in <em>this</em> you come to
understand what it is <em>for</em>.
</p>

<p>
Why would you seek to try another road, another person or another place, when
you have learned the way the lesson starts, but do not yet perceive what it is
for? Its purpose is the <em>answer</em> to the search that all must undertake
who still believe there is another answer to be found. Learn now, without
despair, there is no hope of answer in the world. But do not judge the lesson
which is but <em>begun</em> with this. Seek not another signpost in the world
which seems to point to still another road. No longer look for hope where
there is none. Make fast your learning <em>now</em>, and understand you but
waste time unless you go beyond what you have learned to what is yet to learn.
For from this lowest point will learning lead to heights of happiness, in
which you see the purpose of the lesson shining clear, and perfectly within
your learning grasp.
</p>

<p>
Who would be willing to be turned away from all the roadways of the world,
unless he understood their real futility? Is it not needful that he should
begin with this, to seek another way instead? For while he sees a choice where
there is none, what power of decision can he use? The great release of power
must begin with learning where it really has a <em>use</em>. And what decision
has power if it be applied in situations
without choice?
</p>

<p>
The learning that the world can offer but one choice, no matter what its form
may be, is the beginning of acceptance that there is a <em>real</em>
alternative instead. To fight against this step is to defeat your purpose
here. You did not come to learn to find a road the world does not contain. The
search for different pathways in the world is but the search for different
forms of truth. And this would <em>keep</em> the truth from being reached.
</p>

<p>
Think not that happiness is ever found by following a road <em>away</em> from
it. This makes no sense, and <em>cannot</em> be the way. To you who seem to
find this course to be too difficult to learn, let me repeat that, to achieve
a goal, you must proceed in its direction, <em>not</em> away from it. And
every road that leads the other way will not advance the purpose to be found.
If <em>this</em> be difficult to understand, then <em>is</em> this course
impossible to learn. But only then. For otherwise, it is a simple teaching in
the obvious.
</p>

<p>
There <em>is</em> a choice which you have power to make when you have seen the
real alternatives. Until that point is reached you <em>have</em> no choice,
and you can but decide how you would choose the better to deceive yourself
again. This course attempts to teach no more than that the power of decision
cannot lie in choosing different forms of what is still the <em>same</em>
illusion and the <em>same</em> mistake. All choices in the world depend on
this; you choose between your brother and yourself, and you will gain as much
as he will lose, and what you lose is what is given him. How utterly opposed
to truth is this, when the lesson’s purpose is to teach that what your brother
loses <em>you</em> have lost, and what he gains is what is given <em>you</em>.
</p>

<p>
He has not left His Thoughts! But you forgot His Presence, and remembered not
His love. No pathway in the world can lead to Him, nor is any worldly goal is
one with His. What road in all the world will lead within, when every road was
made to separate the journey from the purpose it <em>must</em> have unless it
be but futile wandering? All roads that lead away from what you are will lead
you to confusion and despair. Yet has He never left His Thoughts to die,
without their Source forever in themselves. He has not left His Thoughts! He
could no more depart from them than they could keep Him out. In unity with Him
do they abide, and in their Oneness both are kept complete.
</p>

<p>
There <em>is</em> no road that leads away from Him. A journey from
<em>yourself</em> does not exist. How foolish and insane it is to think that
there could be a road with such an aim! Where could it go? And how could you
be made to travel on it, walking there without your own reality at one with
you? Forgive yourself your madness, and forget all senseless journeys and all
goal-less aims. They have no meaning. You can not escape from what you are.
For God <em>is</em> merciful, and did not let His Son abandon Him. For what He
is, be thankful, for in that is your escape from madness and from death.
Nowhere but where He is can <em>you</em> be found. There <em>is</em> no path
that does not lead to Him.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">
E. Self-Concept versus Self
</h2>

<p>The learning of the world is built upon a concept of the self adjusted to the world’s reality. It fits it well. For this an image is that suits a world of shadows and illusions. Here it walks at home, where what it sees is one with it. The building of a concept of the self is what the learning of the world is <em>for</em>. This is its purpose; that you come without a self, and make one as you go along. And by the time you reach “maturity”, you have perfected it to meet the world on equal terms, at one with its demands.</p>

<p>
A <em>concept</em> of the self is made by <em>you</em>. It bears no likeness
to yourself at all. It is an idol, made to take the place of your reality as
Son of God. The concept of the self the world would teach is not the thing
that it appears to be. For it is made to serve two purposes, but one of which
the mind can
recognise. The first presents the face of innocence, the aspect acted
<em>on</em>. It is this face that smiles and charms and even seems to love. It
searches for companions, and it looks, at times with pity, on the suffering,
and sometimes offers solace. It believes that it is good, within an evil
world.
</p>

<p>
This aspect can grow angry, for the world is wicked, and unable to provide the
love and shelter innocence deserves. And so this face is often wet with tears
at the injustices the world accords to those who would be generous and good.
This aspect never makes the first attack. But every day a hundred little
things make small assaults upon its innocence, provoking it to irritation, and
at last to open insult and abuse.
</p>

<p>The face of innocence the concept of the self so proudly wears can tolerate attack in self-defence, for is it not a well-known fact the world deals harshly with defenceless innocence? No one who makes a picture of himself omits this face, for he has need of it. The other side, he does not <em>want</em> to see. Yet it is here the learning of the world has set its sights, for it is here the world’s “reality” is set, to see to it the idol lasts.</p>

<p>
Beneath the face of innocence there is a lesson that the concept of the self
was made to teach. It is a lesson in a terrible displacement, and a fear so
devastating that the face which smiles above it must forever look away, lest
it perceive the treachery it hides. The lesson teaches this: “I am the thing
you
made of me, and as you look on me you stand condemned, because of what I am”.
On this conception of the self the world smiles with approval, for it
guarantees the pathways of the world are safely kept, and those who walk on
them will not escape.
</p>

<p>
Here is the central lesson that ensures your brother is condemned eternally.
For what you are has now become <em>his</em> sin. For this is no forgiveness
possible. No longer does it matter what he does, for your accusing finger
points to him, unwavering and deadly in its aim. It points to you as well, but
this is kept still deeper in the mists below the face of innocence. And in
these shrouded vaults are all his sins and yours preserved, and kept in
darkness, where they cannot be perceived as errors, which the light would
surely show. You can be neither blamed for what you are, nor can you change
the things it makes you do. And you are each the symbol of your sins to one
another, silently, and yet with ceaseless urgency, condemning still your
brother for the hated thing you are.
</p>

<p>Concepts are learned. They are not natural. Apart from learning they do not exist. They are not given, and they must be made. Not one of them is true, and many come from feverish imaginations, hot with hatred and distortions born of fear. What is a concept but a thought to which its maker gives a meaning of his own? Concepts maintain the world. But they can not be used to demonstrate the world is real. For all of them are made within the world, born in its shadow, growing in its ways, and finally “maturing” in its thought. They are ideas of idols, painted with the brushes of the world, which cannot make a single picture representing truth. </p>

<p>
A concept of the self is meaningless, for no one here can see what it is
<em>for</em>, and therefore cannot picture what it <em>is</em>. Yet is all
learning which the world directs begun and ended with the single aim of
teaching you this concept of yourself, that you will choose to follow this
world’s laws, and never seek to go beyond its roads, nor realise the way you
see yourself. Now must the Holy Spirit find a way to help you see this concept
of the self must be undone, if any peace of mind is to be given you. Nor can
it be unlearned except by lessons aimed to teach that you are something
<em>else</em>. For otherwise, you would be asked to make exchange of what you
now believe for total loss of self, and greater terror would arise in you.
</p>

<p>Thus are the Holy Spirit’s lesson plans arranged in easy steps, that though there be some lack of ease at times and some distress, there is no shattering of what was learned, but just a retranslation of what seems to be the evidence on its behalf. Let us consider, then, what proof there is that you are what your brother made of you. For even though you do not yet perceive that this is what you think, you surely learned by now that you <em>behave</em> as if it were. Does <em>he</em> reäct for <em>you</em>? And did he know exactly what would happen? Could he see your future and ordain, before it came, what you should do in every circumstance? He must have made the world as well as you, to have such prescience in the things to come.</p>

<p>That you are what your brother made of you seems most unlikely. Even if he did, who gave the face of innocence to you? Is this <em>your</em> contribution? Who is, then, the “you” who made it? And who is deceived by all your goodness, and attacks it so? Let us forget the concept’s foolishness, and merely think of this: there are two parts to what you think yourself to be. If one was generated by your brother, who was there to make the other? And from whom must something be kept hidden? If the world be evil, there is still no need to hide what <em>you</em> are made of. Who is there to see? And what but is attacked could <em>need</em> defence?</p>

<p>
Perhaps the reason why this concept must be kept in darkness is that, in the
light, the one who would not think it true is <em>you</em>. And what would
happen to the world you know, if all its underpinnings were removed? Your
concept of the world <em>depends</em> upon this concept of the self. And both
would go, if either one were ever raised to doubt. The Holy Spirit does not
seek to throw you into panic. So He merely asks if just a <em>little</em>
question might be raised.
</p>

<p>
There are alternatives about the thing that you must be. You might, for
instance, be the thing you chose to have your <em>brother</em> be. This shifts
the concept of the self from what is wholly passive, and at least makes way
for active choice, and some acknowledgment that interaction must have entered
in. There is some understanding that you chose for both of you, and what he
represents has meaning that was given it by you. It also shows some glimmering
of sight into perception’s law that what you see reflects the state of the
<em>perceiver</em>’s mind. Yet who was it that did the choosing first? If you
are what you chose your brother be, alternatives were there to choose among,
and someone must have first decided on the one to choose, and let the others
go.
</p>

<p>
Although this step has gains, it does not yet approach a basic question.
Something must have gone <em>before</em> these concepts of the self. And
something must have done the learning which gave rise to them. Nor can this be
explained by either view. The main advantage of the shifting to the second
from the first is that <em>you</em> somehow entered in the choice by your
decision. But this gain is paid in almost equal loss, for now <em>you</em>
stand accused of guilt for what your brother is. And you must share his guilt,
because you chose it for him in the image of your own. While only he was
treacherous before, now must you be condemned along with him.
</p>

<p>
The concept of the self has always been the great preöccupation of the world.
And everyone believes that he must find the answer to the riddle of himself.
Salvation can be seen as nothing more than the <em>escape</em> from concepts.
It does not concern itself with content of the mind, but with the simple
statement that it <em>thinks</em>. And what can think has choice, and
<em>can</em> be shown that different thoughts have different consequence. So
it can learn that everything it thinks reflects the deep confusion that it
feels about how it was made, and what it is. And vaguely does the concept of
the self appear to answer what it does not know.
</p>

<p>
Seek not your Self in symbols. There can <em>be</em> no concept that can stand
for what you are. What matters it which concept you accept while you perceive
a self which interacts with evil, and reäcts to wicked things? Your concept of
yourself will still remain quite meaningless. And you will not perceive that
you can interact but with yourself. To see a guilty world is but the sign your
learning has been guided by the world, and you behold it as you see yourself.
The concept of the self embraces all you look upon, and nothing is outside of
this perception. If you can be hurt by anything, you see a picture of your
secret wishes. Nothing more than this. And in your suffering of any kind, you
see your own concealed desire to kill.
</p>

<p>
You will make many concepts of the self as learning goes along. Each one will
show the changes in your own relationships, as your perception of yourself is
changed. There will be some confusion every time there is a shift, but be you
thankful that the learning of the world is loosening its grasp upon your mind.
And be you sure and happy in the confidence that it will go at last, and leave
your mind at peace. The role of the accuser will appear in many places and in
many forms. And each will seem to be accusing <em>you</em>. Yet have no fear
it will not be undone.
</p>

<p>
The world can teach no images of you unless you <em>want</em> to learn them.
There will come a time when images have all gone by, and you will see you know
not what you are. It is to this unsealed and open mind that truth returns,
unhindered and unbound. Where concepts of the self have been laid by is truth
revealed exactly as it <em>is</em>. When every concept has been raised to
doubt and question, and been recognised as made on no assumptions which would
stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean
and free of guilt. There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear
than this:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing,
where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet in this learning is salvation born. And what you are will <em>tell</em>
you of Itself.
</p>

<h2 id="s6">
F. Recognising the Spirit
</h2>

<p>
You see the flesh or recognise the Spirit. There is no compromise between the
two. If one is real the other must be false, for what is real denies its
opposite. There is no choice in vision but this one. What you decide in this
determines <em>all</em> you see and think is real and hold as true. On this
one choice does all your world depend, for here have you established what you
are, as flesh or Spirit in your own belief. If you choose flesh, you never
will escape the body as your own reality, for you have chosen that you
<em>want</em> it so. But choose the Spirit, and all Heaven bends to touch your
eyes and bless your holy sight, that you may see the world of flesh no more
except to heal and comfort and to bless.
</p>

<p>
Salvation is undoing. If you choose to see the body, you behold a world of
separation, unrelated things, and happenings that make no sense at all. This
one appears and disappears in death; that one is doomed to suffering and loss.
And no one is exactly as he was an instant previous, nor will he be the same
as he is now an instant hence. Who could have trust where so much change is
seen, for who is worthy if he be but dust? Salvation is undoing of all this.
And constancy arises in the sight of those whose eyes salvation has released
from looking at the cost of keeping guilt, because they chose to let it go
instead.
</p>

<p>
Salvation does not ask that you behold the Spirit and perceive the body not.
It merely asks that this should be your <em>choice</em>. For you can see the
body without help, but do not understand how to behold a world apart from it.
It is your world salvation will undo, and let you see another world
<em>your</em> eyes could never find. Be not concerned how this could ever be.
You do not understand how what you see arose to meet your sight. For if you
did, it would be gone. The veil of ignorance is drawn across the evil and the
good, and must be passed that both may disappear, so that perception finds no
hiding place. How is this done? It is not done at all. What could there be
within the universe which God created that must still be done?
</p>

<p>
Only in arrogance could you conceive that <em>you</em> must make the way to
Heaven plain. The means are given you by which to see the world that will
replace the one you made. Your will be done! In Heaven as on earth this is
forever true. It matters not where you believe you are, nor what you think the
truth about yourself must really be. It makes no difference what you look
upon, nor what you choose to feel or think or wish. For God Himself has said,
“Your will be done”. And it <em>is</em> done to you accordingly.
</p>

<p>
You who believe that you can choose to see the Son of God as you would have
him be, forget not that no concept of yourself will stand against the truth of
what you are. Undoing truth would be impossible. But concepts are not
difficult to change. <em>One</em> vision, clearly seen, that does not fit the
picture as it was perceived before will change the world for eyes that learn
to see, because the concept of the <em>self</em> has changed. Are <em>you</em>
invulnerable? Then the world is harmless in your sight. Do <em>you</em>
forgive? Then is the world forgiving, for you have forgiven it its trespasses,
and so it looks on you with eyes that see as yours. Are <em>you</em> a body?
So is all the world perceived as treacherous, and out to kill.
</p>

<p>
Are you a Spirit, deathless, and without the promise of corruption and the
stain of sin upon you? So the world is seen as stable, fully worthy of your
trust; a happy place to rest in for a while, where nothing need be feared, but
only loved. Who is unwelcome to the kind in heart? And what could hurt the
truly innocent? Your will be done, you holy Child of God. It does not matter
if you think you are in earth or Heaven. What your Father wills for you can
never change. The truth in you remains as radiant as a star, as pure as light,
as innocent as Love Itself. And you <em>are</em> worthy that your Will be
done!
</p>

<h2 id="s7">
G. The Saviour’s Vision
</h2>

<p>Learning is change. Salvation does not seek to use a means as yet too alien to your thinking to be helpful, nor to make the kinds of change you could not recognise. Concepts are needed while perception lasts, and <em>changing</em> concepts is salvation’s task. For it must deal in contrasts, not in truth, which has no opposite and cannot change. In this world’s concepts are the guilty “bad”; the “good” are innocent. And no one here but holds a concept of himself in which he counts the “good” to pardon him the “bad”. Nor does he trust the “good” in anyone, believing that the “bad” must lurk behind. This concept emphasises treachery, and trust becomes impossible. Nor could it change while you perceive the “bad” in <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>You could not <em>recognise</em> your “evil” thoughts as long as you see value in attack. You will perceive them sometimes, but will not see them as meaningless. And so they come in fearful form, with content still concealed, to shake your sorry concept of yourself, and blacken it with still another “crime”. You cannot give yourself your innocence, for you are too confused about yourself. But should <em>one</em> brother dawn upon your sight as wholly worthy of forgiveness, then your concept of yourself <em>is</em> wholly changed. <em>Your</em> “evil” thoughts have been forgiven with his, because you let them all affect you not. No longer did you choose that you should be the sign of evil and of guilt in him. And as you gave your trust to what is good in him, you gave it to the good in you. </p>

<p>In terms of concepts, it is thus you see him more than just a body, for the good is never what the body seems to be. The actions of the body are perceived as coming from the “baser” part of you, and thus of him as well. By focusing upon the good in him, the body grows decreasingly persistent in your sight, and will at length be seen as little more than just a shadow circling around the good. And this will be your concept of <em>yourself</em>, when you have reached the world beyond the sight your eyes alone can offer you to see. For you will not interpret what you see without the Aid that God has given you. And in His sight there <em>is</em> another world.</p>

<p>
You live in that world just as much as this. For both are concepts of
yourself, which can be interchanged but never jointly held. The contrast is
far greater than you think, for you will love this concept of yourself,
because it was not made for you alone. Born as a gift for someone not
perceived to be yourself, it has been given <em>you</em>. For your
forgiveness, offered unto him, has been accepted now for <em>both</em> of you.
</p>

<p>Have faith in him who walks with you, so that your fearful concept of yourself may change. And look upon the good in him, that you may not be frightened by your “evil” thoughts, because they do not cloud your view of him. And all this shift requires is that you be <em>willing</em> that this happy change occur. No more than this is asked. On its behalf, remember what the concept of yourself which now you hold has brought you in its wake, and welcome the glad contrast offered you. Hold out your hand, that you may have the gift of kind forgiveness which you offer one whose need for it is just the same as yours. And let the cruel concept of yourself be changed to one which brings the peace of God.</p>

<p>
The concept of yourself which now you hold would guarantee your function here
remain forever unaccomplished and undone. And thus it dooms you to a bitter
sense of deep depression and futility. Yet it need not be fixed unless you
choose to hold it past the hope of change, and keep it static and concealed
within your mind. Give it instead to Him Who understands the changes that it
needs to let it serve the function given you to bring you peace, that you may
offer peace to have it yours. Alternatives are in your mind to use, and you
<em>can</em> see yourself another way. Would you not rather look upon yourself
as <em>needed</em> for salvation of the world, instead of as salvation’s
enemy?
</p>

<p>
The concept of the self stands like a shield, a silent barricade before the
truth, and hides it from your sight. All things you see are images, because
you look on them as through a barrier which dims your sight and warps your
vision, so that you behold nothing with clarity. The light is kept from
everything you see. At most, you glimpse a shadow of what lies beyond. At
least, you merely look on darkness, and perceive the terrified imaginings that
come from guilty thoughts and concepts born of fear. And what you see is hell,
for fear <em>is</em> hell. All that is given you is for release; the sight,
the vision and the inner Guide all lead you out of hell with those you love
beside you, and the universe with them.
</p>

<p>
Behold your role within the universe! To every part of true creation has the
Lord of Love and Life entrusted <em>all</em> salvation from the misery of
hell. And to each one has He allowed the grace to be a Saviour to the holy
ones especially entrusted to his care. And this he learns when first he looks
upon <em>one</em> brother as he looks upon himself, and sees the mirror of
himself in him. Thus is the concept of himself laid by, for nothing stands
between his sight and what he looks upon, to judge what he beholds. And in
this single vision does he see the face of Christ, and understands he looks on
everyone as he beholds this One. For there is light where darkness was before,
and now the veil is lifted from his sight.
</p>

<p>
The veil across the face of Christ, the fear of God and of salvation, and the
love of guilt and death, they all are different names for just one error: that
there is a space between you and your brother, kept apart by an illusion of
yourself which holds him off from you, and you away from him. The sword of
judgement is the weapon which you give to the illusion of yourself, that it
may fight to keep the space that holds your brother off unoccupied by love.
Yet while you hold this sword, you must perceive the body as
<em>yourself</em>, for you are bound to separation from the sight of him who
holds the mirror to another view of what he is, and thus what <em>you</em>
must be.
</p>

<p>
What is temptation but the <em>wish</em> to stay in hell and misery? And what
could this give rise to but an image of yourself that <em>can</em> be
miserable, and remain in hell and torment? Who has learned to see his brother
<em>not</em> as this has saved himself, and thus is he a Saviour to the rest.
To everyone has God entrusted all, because a partial saviour would be one who
is but partly saved. The holy ones whom God has given each of you to save are
everyone you meet or look upon, not knowing who they are; all those you saw an
instant and forgot, and those you knew a long while since, and those you will
yet meet, the unremembered and the not yet born. For God has given you His Son
to save from every concept that he ever held.
</p>

<p>
Yet while you wish to stay in hell, how could you be the Saviour of the Son of
God? How would you know his holiness while you see him apart from yours? For
holiness is seen through holy eyes that look upon the innocence within, and
thus expect to see it everywhere. And so they call it forth in everyone they
look upon, that he may be what they expect of him. This is the Saviour’s
vision: that he see his innocence in all he looks upon, and sees his own
salvation everywhere. He holds no concept of himself between his calm and open
eyes and what he sees. He <em>brings</em> the light to what he looks upon,
that he may see it as it really is.
</p>

<p>
Whatever form temptation seems to take, it always but reflects a wish to be a
self which you are not. And from that wish a concept rises, teaching that you
<em>are</em> the thing you wish to be. It will remain your concept of yourself
until the wish that fathered it no longer is held dear. But while you cherish
it, you will behold your brother in the likeness of the self whose image has
the wish begot of <em>you</em>. For vision <em>can</em> but represent a wish,
because it has no power to create. Yet it can look with love or look with
hate, depending only on the simple choice of whether you would join with what
you see, or keep yourself apart and separate.
</p>

<p>
The Saviour’s vision is as innocent of what your brother is as it is free of
any judgement made upon yourself. It sees no past in anyone at all. And thus
it serves a wholly open mind, unclouded by old concepts, and prepared to look
on only what the present holds. It cannot judge because it does not know. And
<em>recognising</em> this, it merely asks, “What is the meaning of what I
behold?”. Then is the answer given. And the door held open for the face of
Christ to shine upon the one who asks, in innocence, to see beyond the veil of
old ideas and ancient concepts held so long and dear <em>against</em> the
vision of the Christ in you.
</p>

<p>
Be vigilant against temptation, then, remembering that it is but a wish,
insane and meaningless, to make yourself a thing which you are not. And think
as well upon the thing that you would be instead. It is a thing of madness,
pain and death; a thing of treachery and black despair, of failing dreams and
no remaining hope except to die, and end the dream of fear. <em>This</em> is
temptation; nothing more than this. Can <em>this</em> be difficult to choose
<em>against</em>? Consider what temptation <em>is</em>, and see the real
alternatives you choose between. There <em>are</em> but two. Be not deceived
by what appears as many choices. There is hell or Heaven, and of these you
choose but <em>one</em>.
</p>

<p>
Let not the world’s light, given unto you, be hidden from the world. It
<em>needs</em> the light, for it is dark indeed, and men despair because the
Saviour’s vision is withheld, and what they see is death. Their Saviour
stands, unknowing and unknown, beholding them with eyes unopened. And they
cannot see until he looks on them with seeing eyes, and offers them
forgiveness with his own. Can you to whom God says, “Release My Son!” be
tempted not to listen, when you learn that it is <em>you</em> for whom He asks
release? And what but this is what this course would teach? And what but this
is there for you to learn?
</p>

<h2 id="s8">
H. Choose Once Again
</h2>

<p>
Temptation has one lesson it would teach, in all its forms, whereëver it
occurs. It would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must
die, unable to escape its frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel. It
sets the limits on what he can do; its power is the only strength he has; his
grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. Would you <em>be</em> this, if Christ
appeared to you in all His glory, asking you but this:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Choose once again if you would take your place among the Saviours of the
world, or would remain in hell, and hold your brothers there.”
</blockquote>

<p>
For He <em>has</em> come, and He <em>is</em> asking this.
</p>

<p>
How do you make the choice? How easily is this explained! You always choose
between your weakness and the
strength of Christ in you. And what you choose is what you think is real.
Simply by never using weakness to direct your actions, you have given it no
power. And the light of Christ in you is given charge of everything you do.
For you have brought your weakness unto Him, and He has given you His strength
instead.
</p>

<p>
Trials are but lessons which you failed to learn presented once again, so
where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus
escape all pain which what you chose before has brought to you. In every
difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently
says, “My brother, choose again”. He would not leave one source of pain
unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth. He would remove all misery
from you whom God created altars unto joy. He would not leave you comfortless,
alone in dreams of hell, but would release your minds from everything that
hides His face from you. His holiness is yours because He is the <em>only</em>
power that is real in you. His strength is yours because He is the Self that
God created as His <em>only</em> Son.
</p>

<p>
The images you make can <em>not</em> prevail against what God Himself would
have you be. Be never fearful of temptation, then, but see it as it is:
another chance to choose again, and let Christ’s strength prevail in every
circumstance and every place you raised an image of yourself before. For what
appears to hide the face of Christ is powerless before His majesty, and
disappears before His holy sight. The Saviours of the world, who see like Him,
are merely those who chose His strength instead of their own weakness, seen
apart from Him. They will redeem the world, for they are joined in all the
power of the Will of God. And what they will is <em>only</em> what He wills.
</p>

<p>
Learn, then, the happy habit of response to all temptation to perceive
yourself as weak and miserable with these words:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I am as God created me. His Son can suffer nothing. And I <em>am</em> His
Son.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus is Christ’s strength invited to prevail, replacing all your weakness with
the strength that comes from God, and that can never fail. And thus are
miracles as natural as fear and agony appeared to be before the choice for
holiness was made. For in that choice are false distinctions gone, illusory
alternatives laid by, and nothing left to interfere with truth.
</p>

<p>
You <em>are</em> as God created you, and so is every living thing you look
upon, regardless of the images you see. What you behold as sickness and as
pain, as weakness and as suffering and loss, is but temptation to perceive
yourself defenceless and in hell. Yield not to this, and you will see all
pain, in every form, whereëver it occurs, but disappear as mists before the
sun. A miracle has come to heal God’s Son, and close the door upon his dreams
of weakness, opening the way to his salvation and release. Choose once again
what you would have him be, remembering that every choice you make establishes
your own identity as you will see it, and believe it <em>is</em>.
</p>

<p>
Deny me not the little gift I ask, when in exchange I lay before your feet the
peace of God, and power to bring this peace to everyone who wanders in the
world uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear. For it is given you to join
with him, and through the Christ in you unveil his eyes, and let him look upon
the Christ in him. My brothers in salvation, do not fail to hear my voice and
listen to my words. I ask for nothing but your <em>own</em> release. There is
no place for hell within a world whose loveliness can yet be so intense and so
inclusive it is but a step from there to Heaven. To your tired eyes I bring a
vision of a different world, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the
pain and sorrow that you saw before. Yet this a vision is which you must share
with everyone you see, for otherwise you will behold it not. To give this gift
is how to make it yours. And God ordained, in loving kindness, that it
<em>be</em> for you.
</p>

<p>Let us be glad that we can walk the world, and find so many chances to perceive another situation where God’s gift can once again be recognised as ours! And thus will all the vestiges of hell, the secret “sins” and hidden hates be gone. And all the loveliness which they concealed appear like lawns of Heaven to our sight, to lift us high above the thorny roads we travelled on before the Christ appeared. Hear me, my brothers, hear and join with me. God has ordained I cannot call in vain, and in His certainty I rest content. For you <em>will</em> hear, and you <em>will</em> choose again. And in this choice is everyone made free. </p>

<p>
I thank You, Father, for these holy ones who are my brothers as they are Your
Sons. My faith in them is Yours. I am as sure that they will come to me as You
are sure of what they are, and will forever be. They will accept the gift I
offer them, because You gave it me on their behalf. And as I would but do Your
holy Will, so will they choose. And I give thanks for them. Salvation’s song
will echo through the world with every choice they make. For we are one in
purpose, and the end of hell is near.
</p>

<p>
In joyous welcome is my hand outstretched to every brother who would join with
me in reaching past temptation, and who looks with fixed determination toward
the light that shines beyond in perfect constancy. Give me my own, for they
belong to You. And can You fail in what is but Your Will? I give You thanks
for what my brothers are. And as each one elects to join with me, the song of
thanks from earth to Heaven grows from tiny scattered threads of melody to one
inclusive chorus from a world redeemed from hell, and giving thanks to You.
</p>

<p>
And now we say “Amen.” For Christ has come to dwell in the abode You set for
Him before time was, in calm eternity. The journey closes, ending at the place
where it began. No trace of it remains. Not one illusion is accorded faith,
and not one spot of darkness still remains to hide the face of Christ from
anyone. Your Will is done, complete and perfectly, and all creation recognises
You, and knows You as the only Source it has. Clear in Your Likeness does the
Light shine forth from everything that lives and moves in You. For we have
reached where all of us are One, and we are home, where You would have us be.
</p>
