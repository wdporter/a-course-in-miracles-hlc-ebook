title: 13. From Perception to Knowledge
permalink: text-13.xhtml

<h2 id="a">13.A. Introduction</h2>

<p>All therapy is release from the past. That is why the Holy Spirit is the only therapist. He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which belongs to the sphere of knowledge, and which therefore no one in the world knows. It would indeed be impossible to <em>be</em> in the world with this knowledge. For the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also that it dwells in eternity, and utilises no perception at all. It therefore does not consider where it is, because the concept “where” does not mean anything to it. It knows that it is <em>everywhere</em>, just as it <em>has everything</em>, and <em>forever</em>. </p>

<p>The very real difference between perception and knowledge becomes quite apparent if you consider this: There is nothing partial about knowledge. Every aspect is whole,and therefore no aspect is separate. <em>You</em> are an aspect of knowledge, being in the Mind of God, Who <em>knows</em> you. All knowledge must be yours, for in you <em>is</em> all knowledge. Perception,at its loftiest, is never complete. Even the perception of the Holy Spirit, as perfect as perception can be, is without meaning in Heaven. Perception can reach everywhere underHis guidance, for the vision of Christ beholds everything in light. Yet no perception, however holy, will last forever.</p>

<h2 id="s2">13.B. The Role of Healing</h2>

<p>Perfect perception, then, has many elements in common with knowledge, making transfer to it possible. Yet the last step must be taken by God, because the last step in your redemption,which seems to be in the future, was accomplished by God in your creation. The separation has not interrupted it. Creation cannot <em>be</em> interrupted. The separation is merely a faulty formulation of reality, with no effect at all. The miracle,without a function in Heaven, <em>is</em> needful here. Aspects of reality can still be seen, and they will replace aspects of <em>un</em>reality. Aspects of reality can be seen in everything and everywhere. Yet only God can gather them together by crowning them as one with the final gift of eternity.</p>

<p>Apart from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit has no function. He is not separate from either, being in the mind of both and knowing that Mind is one. He is a Thought of God, and God has given Him to you because He has no Thoughts He does not share. His message speaks of timelessness in time, and that is why Christ’s vision looks on everything with love. Yet even Christ’s vision is not His reality. The golden aspects of reality which spring to light under His loving gaze are partial glimpses of the Heaven that lies <em>beyond</em> them.</p>

<p>This is the miracle of creation: <em>that it is one forever</em>. Every miracle you offer to the Son of God is but the true perception of one aspect of the whole. Though every aspect <em>is</em> the whole, you cannot know this until you see that every aspect is the <em>same</em> , perceived in the <em>same</em> light and <em>therefore</em> one. Everyone seen <em>without</em> the past thus brings you nearer to the end of time by bringing healed and healing sight into the darkness, and enabling the world to see. For light must come into the darkened world to make Christ’s vision possible even here. Help Him to give His gift of light to all who think they wander in the darkness, and let Him gather them into His quiet sight that makes them one.</p>

<p>They are all the same: all beautiful and equal in their holiness. And He will offer them unto His Father as they were offered unto Him. There is <em>one</em> miracle, as there is <em>one</em> reality. And every miracle you do contains them all, as every aspect of reality you see blends quietly into the One Reality of God. The only miracle that ever was is God’s most holy Son, created in the One Reality that is his Father. Christ’s vision is His gift to you. His Being is His Father’s gift to Him.</p>

<p>Be you content with healing, for Christ’s gift you <em>can</em> bestow, and your Father’s gift you <em>cannot</em> lose. Offer Christ’s gift to everyone and everywhere, for miracles, offered the Son of God through the Holy Spirit, attune you to reality. The Holy Spirit knows your part in the redemption, and who are seeking you and where to find them. Knowledge is far beyond your individual concern. You who are part of it and all of it need only realise that it is of the Father, <em>not</em> of you. Your role in the redemption leads you to it by reëstablishing its oneness in your minds.</p>

<p>When you have seen your brothers as yourself you will be <em>released</em> to knowledge, having learned to free yourself of Him Who knows of freedom. Unite with me under the holy banner of His teaching, and as we grow in strength the power of God’s Son will move in us, and we will leave no one untouched and no one left alone. And suddenly time will be over, and we will all unite in the eternity of God the Father. The holy light you saw outside yourself, in every miracle you offered to your brothers, will be <em>returned</em> to you. And <em>knowing</em> that the light is <em>in</em> you, your creations will be there with you, as you are in your Father.</p>

<p>As miracles in this world join you to your brothers, so do your creations establish your fatherhood in Heaven. <em>You</em> are the witnesses to the Fatherhood of God, and He has given you the power to create the witnesses to your fatherhood in Heaven. Deny a brother here, and you deny the witnesses to your fatherhood in Heaven. The miracle which God created is perfect, as are the miracles which <em>you</em> created in His Name. They need no healing, nor do you, when you know <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>Yet in this world your perfection is unwitnessed. God knows it but <em>you</em> do not, and so you do not share His witness to it. Nor do you witness unto Him, for reality is witnessed to as one. God waits your witness to His Son and to Himself. The miracles you do on earth are lifted up to Heaven and to Him. They witness to what you do not know, and as they reach the gates of Heaven God will open them. For never would He leave His own beloved Son outside them and beyond Himself.</p>

<h2 id="s3">13.C. The Shadow of Guilt</h2>

<p>Guilt remains the only thing that hides the Father, for guilt is the attack upon His Son. The guilty <em>always</em> condemn,and having done so they <em>will</em> condemn, linking the future to the past as is the ego’s law. Fidelity unto this law lets no light in, for it <em>demands</em> fidelity to darkness and <em>forbids</em>awakening. The ego’s laws are strict, and breaches are severely punished. Therefore give no obedience to its laws,for they are laws of punishment. And those who follow them believe that they are guilty and so they <em>must</em> condemn. Between the future and the past the laws of God must intervene,if you would free yourselves. Atonement stands between them, like a lamp that shines so brightly that the chain of darkness in which you bound yourselves will disappear.</p>

<p>Release from guilt is the ego’s whole undoing. <em>Make no one fearful</em>, for his guilt is yours, and by obeying the ego’s harsh commandments you bring its condemnation of yourself, and you will not escape the punishment it offers those who obey it. The ego rewards fidelity to it with pain, for faith in it <em>is</em> pain. And faith can be rewarded only in terms of the belief in which the faith was placed. Faith <em>makes</em> the power of belief, and where it is invested determines its reward. For faith is <em>always</em> given what is treasured, and what is treasured <em>is</em> returned to you.</p>

<p>The world can give you only what you gave it, for being nothing but your own projection, it <em>has</em> no meaning apart from what you found in it and placed your faith in. Be faithful unto darkness and you will <em>not</em> see, because your faith will be rewarded as you <em>gave</em> it. You will accept your treasure, and if you place your faith in the past the future <em>will</em> be like it. Whatever you hold as dear you think is <em>yours</em>. The power of your <em>valuing</em> will make it so.</p>

<p>Atonement brings a reëvaluation of everything you cherish, for it is the means by which the Holy Spirit can separate the false and the true, which you have accepted into your minds <em>without distinction</em>. Therefore, <em>you</em> cannot value one without the other, and guilt has become as true <em>for you</em> as innocence. You do not believe the Son of God is guiltless because you see the past and see <em>him</em> not. When you condemn a brother, you are saying, “I who was guilty choose to <em>remain</em> so”. You have denied <em>his</em> freedom, and by so doing you have denied the witness unto <em>yours</em>. You could as easily have <em>freed</em> him from the past, and lifted from his mind the cloud of guilt that binds him to it. And in <em>his</em> freedom would have been your <em>own</em>. </p>

<p>Lay not his guilt upon him, for his guilt lies in his secret that he thinks that he has done this unto <em>you</em>. Would you,then, teach him that he is <em>right</em> in his delusion? The idea that the guiltless Son of God can attack himself and <em>make</em>himself guilty is insane. In <em>any</em> form, in <em>anyone</em>, <em>believe this not</em>. For sin and condemnation are the same, and the belief in one is faith in the other, calling for punishment <em>instead</em>of love. <em>Nothing</em> can justify insanity, and to call for punishment upon yourself <em>must</em> be insane.</p>

<p>See no one, then, as guilty, and you will affirm the truth of guiltlessness unto <em>yourself</em>. In every condemnation that you offer the Son of God lies the conviction of your <em>own</em> guilt. If you would have the Holy Spirit make you free of it, accept His offer of Atonement for all your brothers. For so you learn that it is true for <em>you</em>. Remember always that it is impossible to condemn the Son of God <em>in part</em>. Those whom you see as guilty become the witnesses to guilt in <em>you</em>, and you will <em>see</em> it there, for it <em>is</em> there until it is undone. Guilt is <em>always</em> in your own mind, which has condemned <em>itself</em>. Project it not, for while you do it cannot <em>be</em> undone. With everyone whom you release from guilt great is the joy in Heaven, where the witnesses to your fatherhood rejoice.</p>

<p>Guilt makes you blind, for while you see one spot of guilt within you, you will <em>not</em> see the light. And by projecting it the <em>world</em> seems dark, and shrouded in your guilt. You throw a dark veil over it, and cannot see it <em>because you cannot look within</em>. You are afraid of what you would see there, but it is <em>not</em> there. <em>The thing you fear is gone</em>. If you would look within you would see only the Atonement, shining in quiet and in peace upon the altar to your Father.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid to look within. The ego tells you all is black with guilt within you, and bids you <em>not</em> to look. Instead, it bids you look upon your brothers <em>and see the guilt in them</em>. Yet this you cannot do without remaining blind. For those who see their brothers in the dark, and guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too afraid to look upon the light within. Within you is not what <em>you</em> believe is there, and what you put your faith in.</p>

<p>Within you is the holy sign of perfect faith your Father has in you. He does not value you as you do. He knows Himself, and knows the truth in <em>you</em>. He knows <em>there is no difference</em>, for He knows not of differences. Can <em>you</em> see guilt where God <em>knows</em> there is perfect innocence? You can <em>deny</em> His knowledge, but you cannot <em>change</em> it. Look, then, upon the light He placed within you, and learn that what you feared was there <em>has been</em> replaced with love.</p>

<h2 id="s4">13.D. Release and Restoration</h2>

<p>You are accustomed to the notion that the mind can see the source of pain where it is not. The doubtful service of displacement is to hide the <em>real</em> source of your guilt, and <em>keep</em> from your awareness the full perception <em>that it is insane</em>. Displacement always is maintained by the illusion that the source, from which attention is diverted, must be <em>true</em>. <em>And must be fearful</em>, or you would not have displaced the guilt onto what you believed to be <em>less</em> fearful. You are therefore willing, with little opposition, to look upon all sorts of “sources” underneath awareness, provided that they are not the deeper source to which they bear no real relationship at all. </p>

<p>Insane ideas <em>have</em> no real relationships, for that is <em>why</em> they are insane. No real relationship can rest on guilt, or even hold one spot of it to mar its purity. For all relationships which guilt has touched are used but to avoid the person <em>and</em> the guilt. What strange relationships you have made for this strange purpose! And you forgot that real relationships are holy, and cannot be used by <em>you</em> at all. They are used only by the Holy Spirit, and it is that which <em>makes</em> them pure. If you displace <em>your</em> guilt upon them, the Holy Spirit cannot use them. For by preëmpting for your <em>own</em> ends what you should have given to Him, He cannot use them unto <em>your</em> release. No one who would unite in <em>any</em> way with <em>anyone</em> for his <em>own</em> salvation will find it in that strange relationship. It is not shared, and so it is not real.</p>

<p> In any union with a brother in which you seek to lay your guilt upon him, or share it with him, or perceive his own, you <em>will</em> feel guilty. Nor will you find satisfaction and peace with him because your union with him is <em>not</em> real. You will see guilt in that relationship because you <em>put</em> it there. It is inevitable that those who suffer guilt <em>will</em> attempt to displace it because they <em>do</em> believe in it. Yet, though they suffer, they will not look within and let it <em>go</em>. They cannot know they love, and cannot understand what loving <em>is</em>. Their main concern is to perceive the source of guilt outside themselves, <em>beyond</em> their own control. 
</p>

<p>When you maintain that you are guilty but the source lies in the <em>past</em>, you are <em>not</em> looking inward. The past is not <em>in</em> you. Your weird associations to it have no meaning in the present. Yet you let them stand between you and your brothers, with whom you find no <em>real</em> relationships at all. Can you expect to use your brothers as a means to “solve” the past, and still to see them as they really are? Salvation is not found by those who use their brothers to resolve problems which are not there. You wanted not salvation in the past. Would you impose your idle wishes on the present, and hope to find salvation <em>now</em>?</p>

<p>Determine, then, to be not as you were. Use no relationship to hold you to the past, but with each one, each day, be born again. A minute, even less, will be enough to free you from the past, and give your mind in peace over to the Atonement. When everyone is welcome to you as you would have yourself be welcome to your Father, you will see no guilt in you. For you will have accepted the Atonement, which shone within you all the while you dreamed of guilt, and would not look within and see it.</p>

<p>As long as you believe that guilt is justified in <em>any</em> way, in <em>anyone</em>, <em>whatever</em> he may do, you will not look within, where you would <em>always</em> find Atonement. The end of guilt will never come as long as you believe there is a <em>reason</em> for it. For you must learn that guilt is <em>always</em> totally insane, and <em>has</em> no reason. The Holy Spirit seeks not to dispel reality. If <em>guilt</em> were real, <em>atonement</em> would not be. The purpose of Atonement is to dispel illusions, not to establish them as real and <em>then</em> forgive them. </p>

<p>The Holy Spirit does not keep illusions in your mind to frighten you, and show them to you fearfully to demonstrate what He has saved you <em>from</em>. What He has saved you from is <em>gone</em>. Give no reality to guilt, and see <em>no</em> reason for it. The Holy Spirit does what God would have Him do, and has always done so. He has seen separation, but knows of union. He teaches healing but He also knows of creation. He would have you see and teach as He does, and through Him. Yet what He knows you do not know, though it is yours.</p>

<p><em>Now</em> it is given you to heal and teach, to make what will be <em>now</em>. As yet it is <em>not</em> now. The Son of God believes that he is lost in guilt, alone in a dark world where pain is pressing everywhere upon him from <em>without</em>. When he has looked within and seen the radiance there, he will remember how much his Father loves him. And it will seem incredible that he has ever thought his Father loved him not, and looked upon him as condemned. The moment that you realise guilt is <em>insane</em>, <em>wholly</em> unjustified and <em>wholly</em> without reason, you will not fear to look upon the Atonement and accept it wholly.</p>

<p>You who have been unmerciful unto yourselves do not remember your Father’s Love. And looking without mercy upon your brothers, you do not remember how much You love <em>Him</em>. Yet it is forever true. In shining peace within you is the perfect purity in which you were created. Fear not to look upon the lovely truth in you. Look <em>through</em> the cloud of guilt that dims your vision, and look <em>past</em> darkness to the holy place where you will see the light. The altar to your Father is as pure as He Who raised it to Himself. Nothing can keep from you what Christ would have you see. His will is like His Father’s, and He offers mercy to every Child of God, as He would have <em>you</em> do.</p>

<p><em>Release</em> from guilt as you would <em>be</em> released. There is no other way to look within, and see the light of love shining as steadily and as surely as God Himself has always loved His Son. <em>And as His Son loves him</em>. There is no fear in love, for love is guiltless. You who have always loved your Father can have no fear, for <em>any</em> reason, to look within and see your holiness. You cannot <em>be</em> as you believed you were. Your guilt is without reason because it is not in the Mind of God, where <em>you</em> are. And this <em>is</em> reason, which the Holy Spirit would <em>restore</em> to you. He would remove only illusions. All else He would have you see. And in Christ’s vision He would show you the perfect purity that is forever within God’s Son. </p>

<p>You cannot enter into <em>real</em> relationships with any of God’s Sons unless you love them all and <em>equally</em>. Love is not special. If you single out <em>part</em> of the Sonship for your love, you are imposing guilt on <em>all</em> your relationships, and making them unreal. You can love <em>only</em> as God loves. Seek not to love unlike Him, for there <em>is</em> no love apart from His. Until you recognise that this is true you will have no idea what love is like. No one who condemns a brother can see himself as guiltless in the peace of God. If he <em>is</em> guiltless and in peace and sees it not, he <em>is</em> delusional, and has not looked upon himself. To him I say:</p>

<blockquote>“Behold the Son of God and look upon his purity and be still. In quiet look upon his holiness, and offer thanks unto his Father that no guilt has ever touched him.”</blockquote>

<p>No illusion that you have ever held against him has touched his innocence in any way. His shining purity, wholly untouched by guilt and wholly loving, is bright within you. Let us look upon him together and love him. For in our love of him is your guiltlessness. But look upon yourself, and gladness and appreciation for what you see will banish guilt forever. I thank You, Father, for the purity of Your most holy Son, whom You have created guiltless forever./p>

<p>Like you my faith and my belief are centred on what I treasure. The difference is that I love <em>only</em> what God loves with me, and because of this, I treasure you beyond the value that you set on yourselves, even unto the worth that God has placed upon you. I love all that He created, and all my faith and my belief I offer unto it. My faith in you is strong as all the love I give my Father. My trust in you is without limit, and without the fear that you will hear me not. I thank the Father for your loveliness, and for the many gifts that you will let me offer to the Kingdom in honour of its wholeness which is of God.</p>

<p>Praise be unto you who make the Father One with His Own Son. Alone we are all lowly, but together we shine with brightness so intense that none of us alone can even think on it. Before the glorious radiance of the Kingdom guilt melts away, and transformed into kindness, will never more be what it was. Every reäction that you experience will be so purified that it is fitting as a hymn of praise unto your Father. See only praise of Him in what He has created, for He will never cease His praise of <em>you</em>. United in this praise we stand before the gates of Heaven, where we will surely enter in our blamelessness. God loves you. Could I, then, lack faith in you and love Him perfectly?</p>

<p>Forgetfulness and sleep and even death become the ego’s best advice for how to deal with the perceived and harsh intrusion of guilt on peace. Yet no one sees himself in conflict, and ravaged by a cruel war, unless he believes that <em>both</em> opponents in the war are real. Believing this he must escape, for such a war would surely end his peace of mind, and so destroy him. Yet if he could but realise the war is between forces that are real and <em>unreal</em> powers, he could look upon himself and <em>see</em> his freedom. No one finds himself ravaged and torn in endless battles which he <em>himself</em> perceives as wholly without meaning.</p>

<p>God would not have His Son embattled, and so His Son’s imagined “enemy”, which he made, is <em>totally</em> unreal. You are but trying to escape a bitter war from which you <em>have</em> escaped. The war is gone. For you have heard the hymn of freedom rising unto Heaven. Gladness and joy belong to God for your release because you made it not. Yet as you made not freedom, so you made not a war that could <em>endanger</em> freedom. Nothing destructive ever was or will be. The war, the guilt, the past are gone as one into the unreality from which they came.</p>

<h2 id="s5">13.E. The Guarantee of Heaven</h2>

<p>When we are all united in Heaven, you will value <em>nothing</em> that you value here. For nothing that you value here you value wholly, and so you do not value it at all. Value is where God placed it, and the value of what God esteems cannot <em>be</em> judged, for it has been <em>established</em>. It is <em>wholly</em> of value. It can merely be appreciated or not. To value it partially is not to <em>know</em> its value. In Heaven is everything God valued, and nothing else. Heaven is perfectly unambiguous. Everything is clear and bright, and calls forth <em>one</em> response. There is no darkness, and there is no contrast. There is no variation. There is no interruption. There is a sense of peace so deep that no dream in this world has ever brought even a dim imagining of what it is.</p>

<p>Nothing in this world can give this peace, for nothing in this world is wholly shared. Perfect perception can merely show you what is <em>capable</em> of being wholly shared. It can also show you the <em>results</em> of sharing, while you still remember the results of <em>not</em> sharing. The Holy Spirit points quietly to the contrast, knowing that you will finally let Him judge the difference for you, allowing Him to demonstrate which <em>must</em> be true. He has perfect faith in your final judgement because He knows that He will make it <em>for</em> you. To doubt this would be to doubt that His mission will be fulfilled. How is this possible, when His mission is of God?</p>

<p>You whose minds are darkened by doubt and guilt, remember this: God gave the Holy Spirit to you, and gave Him the mission to remove all doubt and every trace of guilt that His dear Son has laid upon himself. It is <em>impossible</em> that this mission fail. Nothing can prevent what God would have accomplished from accomplishment. Whatever your reäctions to the Holy Spirit’s Voice may be, whatever voice you choose to listen to, whatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God’s Will <em>is</em> done. You <em>will</em> find the peace in which He has established you because He does not change His Mind. He is invariable as the peace in which you dwell, and of which the Holy Spirit reminds you.</p>

<p>You will not remember change and shift in Heaven. You have need of contrast only here. Contrast and differences are necessary teaching aids, for by them you learn what to avoid and what to seek. When you have learned this you will find the answer that makes the need for <em>any</em> differences disappear. Truth comes of its own will unto its own. When you have learned that you <em>belong</em> to truth, it will flow lightly over you without a difference of any kind. For you will need no contrast to help you realise that this is what you want, and <em>only</em> this. Fear not the Holy Spirit will fail in what your Father has given Him to do. The Will of God can fail in <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep <em>you</em> from it or <em>it</em> from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you. The Holy Spirit will restore your sanity because insanity is <em>not</em> the Will of God. If that suffices Him, it is enough for you. You will not keep what God would have removed because it breaks communication with you with whom He would communicate. His Voice <em>will</em> be heard.</p>

<p>The communication link which God Himself placed within you, joining your minds with His, <em>cannot</em> be broken. You may believe you <em>want</em> it broken, and this belief <em>does</em> interfere with the deep peace in which the sweet and constant communication which God would share with you is known. Yet His channels of reaching out cannot be wholly closed and separated from Him. Peace will be yours because His peace still flows to you from Him Whose Will <em>is</em> peace. You have it <em>now</em>. The Holy Spirit will teach you how to <em>use</em> it, and by projecting it to learn that it is in you.</p>

<p>God willed you Heaven, and will <em>always</em> will you nothing else. The Holy Spirit knows <em>only</em> of His Will. There is no chance that Heaven will not be yours, for God is sure, and what He wills is sure as He is. You will learn salvation because you will learn <em>how to save</em>. It will not be possible to exempt yourself from what the Holy Spirit wills to teach you. Salvation is as sure as God. His certainty suffices. Learn that even the darkest nightmare that disturbed the mind of God’s sleeping Son holds no power over him. He <em>will</em> learn the lesson of awaking. God watches over him and light surrounds him.</p>

<p>Can God’s Son lose himself in dreams when God has placed <em>within</em> him the glad call to waken and be glad? He cannot separate <em>himself</em> from what is <em>in</em> him. His sleep will not withstand the call to wake. The mission of redemption will be fulfilled as surely as the creation will remain unchanged throughout eternity. You do not have to know that Heaven is yours to make it so. It <em>is</em> so. Yet the Will of God must be accepted as <em>your</em> will, to know it.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit cannot fail to undo <em>for</em> you everything you have learned that teaches you what is not true must be reconciled with truth. This is the reconciliation which the ego would substitute for your reconciliation unto sanity and unto peace. The Holy Spirit has a very different kind of reconciliation in His Mind for you, and one which He <em>will</em> effect as surely as the ego will <em>not</em> effect what it attempts.</p>

<p>Failure is of the ego, <em>not</em> of God. From Him you <em>cannot</em> wander, and there is no possibility that the plan the Holy Spirit offers to everyone, for the salvation <em>of</em> everyone, will not be perfectly accomplished. You <em>will</em> be released, and you will not remember anything you made that was not created <em>for</em> you and <em>by</em> you in return. For how can you remember what was <em>never</em> true, or <em>not</em> remember what has always been? It is this reconciliation with truth, and <em>only</em> truth, in which the peace of Heaven lies.</p>

<h2 id="s6">13.F. The Testimony of Miracles</h2>

<p>Yes, you are blessed indeed. Yet in this world you do not know it. But you have the means for learning it and seeing it quite clearly. The Holy Spirit uses logic as easily and as well as does the ego, except that His conclusions are <em>not</em> insane. They take a direction exactly opposite, pointing as clearly to Heaven as the ego points to darkness and to death. We have followed much of the ego’s logic, and have seen its logical conclusions. And having seen them, we have realised that they can not be seen but in illusions, for there alone their seeming clearness <em>seems</em> to be clearly seen. Let us now turn away from them, and follow the simple logic by which the Holy Spirit teaches you the simple conclusions that speak for truth, and <em>only</em> truth.</p>

<p>If you are blessed and do not know it, you need to <em>learn</em> it must be so. The knowledge is not taught, but its <em>conditions</em> must be acquired, for it is they that have been thrown away. You <em>can</em> learn to bless, and <em>cannot</em> give what you have not. If, then, you <em>offer</em> blessing, it <em>must</em> have come first to yourself. And you must also have <em>accepted</em> it as yours, for how else could you give it away?</p>

<p>That is why your miracles offer <em>you</em> the testimony that you are blessed. If what you offer <em>is</em> complete forgiveness, you <em>must</em> have let guilt go, accepting the Atonement for yourself and learning you are guiltless. How could you learn what has been done for you, but which you do not know, unless you do what you would <em>have</em> to do if it <em>had</em> been done unto you? <em>In</em>direct proof of truth is needed in a world made of denial and without direction. You will perceive the need for this if you will realise that to deny is the decision <em>not</em> to know. The logic of the world <em>must</em> therefore lead to nothing, for its <em>goal</em> is nothing.</p>

<p>If you decide to have and give and <em>be</em> nothing except a dream, you <em>must</em> direct your thoughts unto oblivion. And if you have and give and are <em>everything</em>, and all this has been <em>denied</em>, your thought system is closed off, and wholly separated from the truth. This <em>is</em> an insane world, and do  not underestimate the actual extent of its insanity. There is no area of your perception that it has not touched, and your dream <em>is</em> sacred to you. That is why God placed the Holy Spirit <em>in</em> you, where you placed the dream.</p>

<p>Seeing is always <em>outward</em>. Were your thoughts wholly of <em>you</em>, the thought system which you made would be forever dark. The thoughts which the mind of God’s Son projects have all the power that he gives to them. The thoughts he shares with God are <em>beyond</em> his belief, but those he made <em>are</em> his beliefs. And it is <em>these</em>, and <em>not</em> the truth, that he has chosen to defend and love. They will not be taken from him. But they can be <em>given up</em> by him, for the Source of their undoing is <em>in</em> him. There is nothing <em>in</em> the world to teach him that the logic of the world is totally insane, and leads to nothing. Yet in him who made this insane logic there is One Who <em>knows</em> it leads to nothing, for He knows everything.</p>

<p>Any direction which will lead you where the Holy Spirit leads you not goes nowhere. Anything you deny which He knows to be true you have denied <em>yourself</em>, and He must therefore teach you <em>not</em> to deny it. Undoing <em>is</em> indirect, as doing is. You were created only to <em>create</em>, neither to see <em>nor</em> do. These are but indirect expressions of the will to live, which has been blocked by the capricious and unholy whim of death and murder that your Father shared not with you. You have set yourselves the task of sharing what can not <em>be</em> shared. And while you think it possible to <em>learn</em> to do this, you will not believe all that <em>is</em> possible to learn to do.</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit, therefore, must begin His teaching by showing you what you can <em>never</em> learn. His <em>message</em> is not indirect, but He must introduce the simple truth into a thought system which has become so twisted and so complex that you cannot <em>see</em> that it means nothing. <em>He</em> merely looks at its foundation and dismisses it. But <em>you</em> who cannot undo what you have made, nor escape the heavy burden of its dullness that lies upon your minds, cannot see <em>through</em> it. It deceives you because you chose to deceive yourselves. Those who choose to <em>be</em> deceived will merely attack direct approaches, which would seem but to encroach upon deception and strike at it.</p>

<h2 id="s7">13.G. The Happy Learner</h2>

<p>The Holy Spirit needs a happy learner, in whom His mission can be happily accomplished. You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must first recognise that you <em>are</em> miserable and <em>not</em> happy. The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery <em>is</em> happiness. This has so confused you that you have undertaken to learn to do what you can <em>never</em> do, believing that <em>unless</em> you learn it, you will not be happy. You do not realise that the foundation on which this most peculiar learning goal depends means <em>absolutely nothing</em>. It <em>does</em> make sense to you.</p>

<p>Have faith in nothing, and you will <em>find</em> the “treasure” that you  ought. Yet you will add another burden to your mind, <em>already</em> burdened or you would not have sought another. You will believe that nothing is <em>of value</em>, and <em>will</em> value it. A little piece of glass, a speck of dust, a body or a war are one to you. For if you value <em>one</em> thing made of nothing, you <em>have</em> believed that nothing can be precious, and that you can learn how to make the untrue <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, <em>seeing</em> where you are but <em>knowing</em> you are elsewhere, begins His lesson in simplicity with the fundamental teaching that <em>truth is true</em>. This is the hardest lesson you will ever learn, and in the end the <em>only</em> one. Simplicity is very difficult for twisted minds. Consider all the distortions you have made of nothing: all the strange forms and feelings and actions and reäctions that you have woven out of it. Nothing is so alien to you as the simple truth, and nothing are you less inclined to listen to. The contrast between  what is true and what is not is <em>perfectly</em> apparent, yet you do not see it.</p>

<p>The simple and the obvious are not apparent to those who would make palaces and royal robes of nothing, believing they are kings with golden crowns because of them. All this the Holy Spirit sees, and teaches, simply, that all this is not true. To these unhappy learners who would teach themselves nothing and delude themselves into believing that it is <em>not</em> nothing, the Holy Spirit says, with steadfast quietness: </p>

<blockquote>“The truth is true. Nothing else matters, nothing else is real, and everything beside it is not there. Let Me make the one distinction for you which you cannot make but need to <strong>learn</strong>. Your faith in nothing <strong>is</strong> deceiving you. Offer your faith to Me, and I will place it gently in the holy place where it belongs. You will find <strong>no</strong> deception there, but only the simple truth. And you will love it because you will <strong>understand</strong> it.”</blockquote>

<p>Like you, the Holy Spirit did not <em>make</em> truth. Like God, He <em>knows</em> it to be true. He brings the light of truth into the darkness, and <em>lets</em> it shine on you. And as it shines, your brothers see it, and realising that this light is not what you have made, they see in you more than <em>you</em> see. They will be happy learners of the lesson which this light brings to them because it teaches them <em>release</em> from nothing and from all the works of nothing. The heavy chains which seem to bind them unto despair they do not see as nothing until you bring the light to them. And <em>then</em> they see the chains have disappeared, and so they <em>must</em> have been nothing. And <em>you</em> will see it with them. <em>Because</em> you taught them gladness and release, they will become <em>your</em> teachers in release and gladness.</p>

<p>When you teach anyone that truth is true, you learn it <em>with</em> him. And so you learn that what seemed hardest was the easiest. Learn to be happy learners. You will <em>never</em> learn how to make nothing everything. Yet see that this <em>has</em> been your goal, and <em>recognise</em> how foolish it has been. Be glad it is undone, for when you look at it in simple honesty, it <em>is</em> undone. We said before, “Be not content with nothing”, for you <em>have</em> believed that nothing could content you. <em>It is not so</em>.</p>

<p>If you would be a happy learner, you must give <em>everything</em> that you have learned over to the Holy Spirit to be <em>unlearned</em> for you. And then begin to learn the joyous lessons that come quickly on the firm foundation that truth is true. For what is built there <em>is</em> true, and <em>built</em> on truth. The universe of learning will open up before you in all its gracious simplicity. With truth before you, you will not look back.</p>

<p>The happy learner meets the conditions of learning here, as he also meets the conditions of knowledge in the Kingdom. All this lies in the Holy Spirit’s plan to free you from the past, and open up the way to freedom for you. For truth <em>is</em> true. What else could ever be, or ever was? This simple lesson holds the key to the dark door which you believe is locked forever. You <em>made</em> this door of nothing, and behind it <em>is</em> nothing. The key is only the light which shines away the shapes and forms and fears of nothing. Accept this key to freedom from the hands of Christ Who gives it to you, that you may join Him in the holy task of bringing light to darkness. For, like your brothers, you do not realise the light has come, and <em>freed</em> you from the sleep of darkness.</p>

<p>Behold your brothers in their freedom, and learn of them how to be <em>free</em> of darkness. The light in you will waken them, and they will not leave <em>you</em> asleep. The vision of Christ is given the very instant that it is perceived. Where everything is clear it is all holy. The quietness of its simplicity is so compelling that you will realise it is <em>impossible</em> to deny the simple truth. For there <em>is</em> nothing else. God is everywhere, and His Son is in Him with everything. Can he sing the dirge of sorrow when <em>this</em> is true? </p>

<h2 id="s8">13.H. The Decision for Guiltlessness</h2>

<p>
Learning will be commensurate with motivation, and the interference in your motivation for learning is exactly the same as that which interferes with <em>all</em> your thinking. The happy learner cannot <em>feel guilty</em> about learning. This is so essential to learning that it should never be forgotten. The guiltless learner learns so easily because his thoughts are free. Yet this entails the recognition that guilt is <em>interference</em>, 
<em>not</em> salvation, and serves no useful function at all.
</p>

<p>
You are accustomed to using guiltlessness merely to offset the pain of guilt, and do not look upon it as having value <em>in itself</em>. You believe that guilt and guiltlessness are <em>both</em> of value, each representing an escape from what the other does not offer you. You do not want either alone, for without both you do not see yourselves as whole and therefore happy. Yet you are whole <em>only</em> in your guiltlessness, and only in your guiltlessness <em>can</em> you be happy. There <em>is</em> no conflict here. To wish for guilt in <em>any</em> way, in <em>any</em> form, will lose appreciation of the value of your guiltlessness, and push it from your sight. 
</p>

<p>
There is no compromise that you can make with guilt,
and escape the pain which <em>only</em> guiltlessness allays. Learning
is living here, as creating is Being in Heaven. Whenever
the pain of guilt <em>seems</em> to attract you, remember that, if you
yield to it, you are deciding <em>against</em> your happiness, and
will not learn <em>how</em> to be happy. Say, therefore, to yourself,
gently, but with the conviction born of the love of God and of
His Son: 
</p>

<blockquote>“What I experience I will make manifest.<br />
If I am guiltless I have nothing to fear.<br />
I choose to testify to my <strong>acceptance</strong> of the<br /> Atonement, <strong>not</strong> for its rejection.<br />
I would accept my guiltlessness by making it<br />
manifest and <strong>sharing</strong> it.<br />
Let me bring peace to God’s Son from his Father.”
</blockquote>

<p>Each day, each hour and minute, even each second, you are deciding between the crucifixion and the resurrection; between the ego and the Holy Spirit. The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit the decision for guiltlessness. The power of decision is all that is yours. What you can decide <em>between</em> is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion. And there is no overlap between them, because they are opposites which <em>cannot</em> be reconciled and <em>cannot</em> both be true. You are guilty <em>or</em> guiltless, bound <em>or</em> free, happy <em>or</em> unhappy.</p>

<p>The miracle teaches you that you have chosen guiltlessness, freedom and joy. It is not a cause, but an <em>effect</em>. It is the natural result of choosing right, attesting to your happiness that comes from choosing to be free of guilt. Everyone you offer healing to returns it. Everyone you attack keeps it and cherishes it by holding it against you. Whether he does this or does it not will make no difference: you will <em>think</em> he does. It is impossible to offer what you do not want without this penalty. The cost of giving <em>is</em> receiving. Either it is a penalty from which you suffer, or the happy purchase of a treasure to hold dear.</p>

<p>No penalty is ever asked of God’s Son except <em>by</em> himself and <em>of</em> himself. Every chance given him to heal is another opportunity to replace darkness with light and fear with love. If he refuses it, he binds himself to darkness because he did not choose to free his brother, and enter light with him. By <em>giving</em> power to nothing, he threw away the joyous opportunity to learn that nothing <em>has</em> no power. And by <em>not</em> dispelling darkness he became afraid of darkness <em>and</em> of light. The joy of learning that darkness has no power over the Son of God is the happy lesson the Holy Spirit teaches, and would have <em>you</em> teach with Him. It is <em>His</em> joy to teach it, as it will be <em>yours</em>.</p>

<p>The way to teach this simple lesson is merely this: Guiltlessness <em>is</em> invulnerability. Therefore, make your invulnerability manifest to everyone, and teach him that, <em>whatever</em> he may try to do to you, your perfect freedom from the belief that you can be harmed shows him <em>he</em> is guiltless. He can do <em>nothing</em> that can hurt you, and by refusing to allow him to <em>think</em> he can, you teach him that the Atonement, which you have accepted for <em>yourself</em>, is also <em>his</em>. There <em>is</em> nothing to forgive. No one can hurt the Son of God. His guilt is wholly without cause, and being without cause <em>cannot</em> exist.</p>

<p>God is the <em>only</em> Cause, and guilt is not of Him. Teach no one he has hurt you, for if you do, you teach yourself that what is not of God <em>has</em> power over you. <em>The causeless cannot be</em>. Do not attest to it, and do not foster belief in it in any mind. Remember always that <em>mind</em> is one and <em>cause</em> is one. You will learn communication with this oneness <em>only</em> when you learn to <em>deny</em> the causeless, and accept the Cause of God as <em>yours</em>. The power that God has given to His Son <em>is</em> his, and nothing else can His Son see or choose to look upon without imposing on himself the penalty of guilt <em>in place</em> of all the happy teaching the Holy Spirit would gladly offer him.</p>

<p>Whenever you decide to make decisions for yourself, you are thinking destructively, and the decision <em>will</em> be wrong. It will hurt you because of the concept of decision which led to it. It is not true that you can make decisions <em>by</em> yourself or <em>for</em> yourself alone. No thought of God’s Son <em>can</em> be separate or isolated in its effects. Every decision is made for the <em>whole</em> Sonship, directed in and out, and influencing a constellation larger than anything you ever dreamed of. Those who accept the Atonement <em>are</em> invulnerable. But those who believe they are guilty <em>will</em> respond to guilt, because they think it is salvation, and will not refuse to see it and side with it. They <em>believe</em> that <em>increasing</em> guilt is self- <em>protection</em>. And they will fail to understand the simple 
fact that what they do not want <em>must</em> hurt them.</p>

<p>All this arises because they do not believe that what they want is <em>good</em>. Yet will was given them <em>because</em> it is holy, and will bring to them <em>all</em> that they need, coming as naturally as peace that knows no limits. There is nothing their wills will not provide that offers them <em>anything</em> of value. Yet because they do not understand their will, the Holy Spirit quietly understands it <em>for</em> them, and <em>gives</em> them what they will without effort, strain, or the impossible burden of deciding what they want and need alone. 
</p>

<p>It will never happen that you will have to make decisions for yourself. You are not bereft of help, and Help that <em>knows</em> the answer. Would you be content with little, which is all that you alone can offer yourself, when He Who gives you everything will simply <em>offer</em> it to you? He will never ask what you have done to make you worthy of the gift of God. Ask it not therefore of yourselves. Instead, accept His answer, for He <em>knows</em> that you are worthy of everything God wills for you. Do not try to escape the gift of God which He so freely and so gladly offers you. He offers you but what God gave Him <em>for</em> you. You need not decide whether or not you are deserving of it. God knows you <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>Would you deny the truth of God’s decision, and place your pitiful appraisal of yourself in place of His calm and unswerving value of His Son? <em>Nothing</em> can shake God’s conviction of the perfect purity of everything that He created, for it <em>is</em> wholly pure. Do not decide against it, for being of Him it <em>must</em> be true. Peace abides in every mind that quietly accepts the plan which God has set for his Atonement, relinquishing his <em>own</em>. You know not of salvation, for you do not understand it. Make no decisions about what it is or where it lies, but ask of the Holy Spirit everything, and leave <em>all</em> decisions to His gentle counsel. </p>

<p>The One Who knows the plan of God which God would have you follow can teach you what it <em>is</em>. Only <em>His</em> wisdom is capable of guiding you to follow it. Every decision you undertake alone but signifies that you would define what salvation <em>is</em>, and what you would be saved <em>from</em>. The Holy Spirit knows that <em>all</em> salvation is escape from guilt. You have no other “enemy”, and against this strange distortion of the purity of the Son of God the Holy Spirit is your <em>only</em> friend. He is the strong protector of your innocence which sets you free. And it is <em>His</em> decision to undo everything that would obscure your innocence from your unclouded mind. </p>

<p>Let Him, therefore, be the <em>only</em> Guide that you would follow to salvation. He knows the way, and leads you gladly on it. <em>With</em> Him you will not fail to learn what God wills for you <em>is</em> your will. <em>Without</em> His guidance you will think you know alone, and will decide <em>against</em> your peace as surely as you made the wrong decision in ever thinking that salvation lay in you alone. Salvation is of Him to Whom God gave it for you. He has not forgotten it. Forget Him not, and He will make every decision for you, for your salvation and the peace of God in you.</p>

<p>Seek not to appraise the worth of God’s Son whom He created holy, for to do so is to evaluate his Father, and judge <em>against</em> Him. And you <em>will</em> feel guilty for this imagined crime, which no one in this world or Heaven could possibly commit. God’s Spirit teaches only that the “sin” of self-replacement on the throne of God is <em>not</em> a source of guilt. What cannot happen can have <em>no</em> effects to fear. Be quiet in your faith in Him Who loves you and would lead you out of insanity. Madness may be your choice, but <em>not</em> your reality. Never forget the Love of God, Who <em>has</em> remembered you. For it is quite impossible that He could ever let His Son drop from His Loving Mind whereïn he was created, and where his abode was fixed in perfect peace forever. </p>

<p>Say to the Holy Spirit only, “Decide for me”, and it is done. For His decisions are reflections of what God <em>knows</em> about you, and in this light error of <em>any</em> kind becomes impossible. Why would you struggle so frantically to anticipate all that you <em>cannot</em> know when all knowledge lies behind every decision which the Holy Spirit makes <em>for</em> you? Learn of His wisdom and His love, and teach His answer to everyone  who struggles in the dark. For you decide for them <em>and</em> for yourself.</p>

<p>How gracious is it to decide all things through Him Whose equal love is given equally to all alike! He leaves you no one <em>outside</em> yourself, alone <em>without</em> you. And so He gives you what is yours because your Father would have you share it with Him. In everything be led by Him, and do not reconsider. Trust Him to answer quickly, surely and with love for everyone who will be touched in any way by the decision. And everyone <em>will</em> be. Would you take unto yourself the sole responsibility for deciding what can bring <em>only</em> good to everyone? Would you <em>know</em> this?</p>

<p>You taught yourselves the most unnatural habit of <em>not</em> communicating with your Creator. Yet you remain in close communication with Him, and with everything that is within Him, as it is within yourself. <em>Unlearn</em> isolation through His loving guidance, and learn of all the happy communication that you have thrown away but could not lose.</p>

<p>Whenever you are in doubt what you should do, think of His Presence in you, and tell yourself this, and <em>only</em> this: </p>

<blockquote>
“He leads me, and knows the way, which I know not.<br />
Yet He will never <strong>keep</strong> from me what He would have me <strong>learn</strong>.<br />
And so I trust Him to communicate to me all that He knows <strong>for</strong> me.”
</blockquote>

<p>Then let Him teach you quietly how to perceive your guiltlessness which is <em>already</em> there.</p>

<h2 id="s9">13.I. The Way of Salvation</h2>

<p>When you accept a brother’s guiltlessness, you will see the Atonement in him. For by proclaiming it in him you make it <em>yours</em>, and you <em>will</em> see what you sought. You will not see the symbol of your brother’s guiltlessness shining within him while you still believe it is not there. <em>His</em> guiltlessness is <em>your</em> Atonement. Grant it to him, and you will see the truth of what you have acknowledged. Yet truth is offered <em>first</em> to be received, even as God gave it first to His Son. The first in time means nothing, but the First in eternity is God the Father, Who is both First and One. Beyond the First there is no other, for there is no order, no second or third, and nothing <em>but</em> the First.</p>

<p>You who belong to the First Cause, created by Him like unto Himself and part of Him, are more than merely guiltless. The state of guiltlessness is only the condition in which what is not there has been removed from the disordered mind that thought it <em>was</em>. This state, and only this, must <em>you</em> attain with God beside you. For until you do, you will still think that you are separate from Him. You can feel His Presence next to you, but <em>cannot</em> know that you are one with Him. This need not be taught. Learning applies only to the condition in which it happens <em>of itself</em>.</p>

<p>When you have let all that obscured the truth in your most holy mind be undone for you and stand in grace before your Father, He will give Himself to you as He has always done. Giving Himself is all He knows, and so it is all knowledge. For what He knows not cannot be, and therefore cannot be given. Ask not to be forgiven, for this has already been accomplished. Ask, rather, to learn how to <em>forgive</em>, and restore what always was to your unforgiving mind. Atonement becomes real and visible to them that <em>use</em> it. On earth this is your only function, and you must learn that it is all you <em>want</em> to learn.</p>

<p>You <em>will</em> feel guilty until you learn this. For, in the end, whatever form it takes, your guilt arises from your failure to fulfil your function in God’s Mind with all of <em>yours</em>. Can you escape this guilt by failing to fulfil your function here? You need not understand creation to do what must be done before that knowledge would be meaningful to you. God breaks no barriers; neither did He <em>make</em> them. When <em>you</em> release them they are gone. God will not fail, nor ever has in anything.</p>

<p>Decide that God is right and <em>you</em> are wrong about yourself. He created you out of Himself, but still within Him. He <em>knows</em> what you are. Remember that there is no second to Him. There cannot, therefore, be anyone without His Holiness, nor anyone unworthy of His perfect Love. Fail not in your function of loving in a loveless place made out of darkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone. Fail not <em>yourself</em>, but instead, offer to God <em>and you</em> His blameless Son. For this small gift of appreciation for His Love, God will Himself exchange your gift for His.</p>

<p>Before you make <em>any</em> decisions for yourself, remember that you have decided <em>against</em> your function in Heaven, and consider carefully whether you <em>want</em> to make decisions here. Your function here is only to decide <em>against</em> deciding what you want, in recognition that you do not <em>know</em>. How, then, can you decide what you should do? Leave all decisions to the One Who speaks for God, and for your function as He <em>knows</em> it. So will He teach you to remove the awful burden you have laid upon yourself by loving not the Son of God, and trying to teach him guilt instead of love. Give up this frantic and insane attempt, which cheats you of the joy of living with your God and Father, and awaking gladly to His Love and Holiness which join together as the truth in you, making you One with Him.</p>

<p>When you have learned how to decide <em>with</em> God, all decisions become as easy and as right as breathing. There is no effort, and you will be led as gently as if you were being carried along a quiet path in summer. Only your own volition seems to make deciding hard. The Holy Spirit will not delay at all in answering your <em>every</em> question what to do. He <em>knows</em>. And He will <em>tell</em> you and then do it <em>for</em> you. You who are tired might consider whether this is not more restful than sleep. For you can bring your guilt into sleeping, but not into this. </p>
