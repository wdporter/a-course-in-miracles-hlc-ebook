<h2 id="s1">A. Introduction</h2>

<p> The wish to be unfairly treated is a compromise attempt that would
<em>combine</em> attack and innocence. Who can combine the wholly
incompatible, and make a unity of what can never join? Walk you the gentle
way, and you will fear no evil and no shadows in the night. But place no
terror symbols on your path, or you will weave a crown of thorns from which
your brother and yourself will not escape. You cannot crucify yourself alone.
And if you are unfairly treated, he must suffer the unfairness that you see.
You cannot sacrifice yourself alone. For sacrifice is total. If it could occur
at all, it would entail the whole of God’s creation, and the Father with the
sacrifice of his beloved Son.
</p>

<p> In your <em>release</em> from sacrifice is his made manifest, and shown to
be his own. But every pain you suffer do you see as proof that he is guilty of
attack. Thus would you make yourself to be the sign that he has lost his
innocence, and need but look on you to realise that he has been condemned. And
what to you has been unfair will come to him in righteousness. The unjust
vengeance that you suffer now belongs to him, and when it rests on him are
<em>you</em> set free. Wish not to make yourself a living symbol of his guilt,
for you will not escape the death you made for him. But in his
<em>innocence</em> you find your own.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">B. The Picture of the Crucifixion</h2>

<p> Whenever you consent to suffer pain, to be deprived, unfairly treated or in
need of anything, you but accuse your brother of attack upon God’s Son. You
hold a picture of your crucifixion before his eyes, that he may see his sins
are writ in Heaven in your blood and death, and go before him, closing off the
gate, and damning him to hell. Yet this is writ in hell and not in Heaven,
where you are beyond attack, and prove his <em>innocence</em>. The picture of
yourself you offer him you show <em>yourself</em>, and give it all your faith.
The Holy Spirit offers you, to give to him, a picture of yourself in which
there is no pain, and no reproach at all. And what was martyred to his guilt
becomes the perfect witness to his innocence. </p>

<p> The power of witness is beyond belief because it brings conviction in its
wake. The witness is believed because he points beyond himself to what he
represents. A sick and suffering you but represents your brother’s guilt; the
witness which you send lest he forget the injuries he gave, from which you
swear he never will escape. This sick and sorry picture <em>you</em> accept,
if only it can serve to punish him. The sick are merciless to everyone, and in
contagion do they seek to kill. Death seems an easy price, if they can say,
“Behold me, brother, at your hand I die”. For sickness is the witness to his
guilt, and death would prove his errors must be sins. </p>

<p> Sickness is but a “little” death; a form of vengeance not yet total. Yet it speaks with certainty for what it represents. The bleak and bitter picture you have sent your brother <em>you</em> have looked upon in grief. And everything that it has shown to him have you believed, because it witnessed to the guilt in him, which you perceived and loved. Now in the hands made gentle by His touch, the Holy Spirit lays a picture of a different you. It is a picture of a body still, for what you <em>really</em> are cannot be seen nor pictured. Yet this one has not been used for purpose of attack, and therefore never suffered pain at all. It witnesses to the eternal truth that you cannot <em>be</em> hurt, and points beyond itself to both your innocence and his. </p>

<p> Show <em>this</em> unto your brother, who will see that every scar is
healed, and every tear is wiped away in laughter and in love. And he will look
on his forgiveness there, and with healed eyes will look beyond it to the
innocence that he beholds in you. Here is the proof that he has never sinned;
that nothing which his madness bid him do was ever done, or ever had effects
of any kind. That no reproach he laid upon his heart was ever justified, and
no attack can ever touch him with the poisoned and relentless sting of fear.
Attest his innocence and <em>not</em> his guilt. <em>Your</em> healing is his
comfort and his health because it <em>proves</em> illusions are not true. </p>

<p> It is not will for life, but wish for death, that is the motivation for this
world. Its only purpose is to prove guilt real. No worldly thought or act or
feeling has a motivation other than this one. These are the witnesses that are
called forth to be believed, and lend conviction to the system they speak for
and represent. And each has many voices, speaking to your brother and yourself
in different tongues. And yet to both the message is the same. Adornment of
the body seeks to show how lovely are the witnesses for guilt. Concerns about
the body demonstrate how frail and vulnerable is your life; how easily
destroyed is what you love. Depression speaks of death and vanity of real
concern with anything at all. The strongest witness to futility, which
bolsters all the rest and helps them paint the picture in which sin is
justified, is sickness in whatever form it takes. </p>

<p> The sick have reason for each one of their unnatural desires and strange
needs. For who could live a life so soon cut short, and not esteem the worth
of passing joys? What pleasures could there be that will endure? Are not the
frail entitled to believe that every stolen scrap of pleasure is their
righteous payment for their little lives? Their death will pay the price for
all of them, if they enjoy their benefits or not. The end of life must come,
whatever way that life be spent. And so take pleasure in the quickly passing
and ephemeral. </p>

<p> These are not sins, but witnesses unto the strange belief that sin and death
are real, and innocence and sin will end alike within the termination of the
grave. If this were true, there <em>would</em> be reason to remain content to
seek for passing joys, and cherish little pleasures where you can. Yet in this
picture is the body not perceived as neutral and without a goal inherent in
itself. For it becomes the symbol of reproach, the sign of guilt whose
consequences still are there to see, so that the cause can never be denied.
</p>

<p> Your function is to show your brother sin can <em>have</em> no cause. How
futile must it be to see yourself a picture of the proof that what your
function is can never be! The Holy Spirit’s picture changes not the body into
something it is not. It only takes away from it all signs of accusation and of
blamefulness. Pictured without a purpose, it is seen as neither sick nor well,
nor bad nor good. No grounds are offered that it may be judged in any way at
all. It has no life, but neither is it dead. It stands apart from all
experience of fear or love. For now it witnesses to nothing yet, its purpose
being open, and the mind made free again to choose what it is <em>for</em>.
Now is it not condemned, but waiting for a purpose to be given, that it may
fulfill the function that it will receive. </p>

<p> Into this empty space, from which the goal of sin has been removed, is Heaven free to be remembered. Here its peace can come, and perfect healing take the place of death. The body can become a sign of life, a promise of redemption, and a breath of immortality to those grown sick of breathing in the fetid scent of death. Let it have healing as its purpose. Then will it send forth the message it received, and by its health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it represents. Let it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever unattacked. And to your brother let its message be, “Behold me, brother, at your hand I live.” </p>

<p> The simple way to let this be achieved is merely this: to let the body have
no purpose from the past, when you were sure you knew its purpose was to
foster guilt. For this insists your crippled picture is a lasting sign of what
it represents. This leaves no space in which a different view, another
purpose, can be given it. You do <em>not</em> know its purpose. You but gave
<em>illusions</em> of a purpose to a thing you made to hide your function from
yourself. This thing without a purpose cannot hide the function that the Holy
Spirit gave. Let, then, its purpose and your function both be reconciled at
last, and seen as one.
</p>

<h2 id="s3">C. The Fear of Healing</h2>

<p> Is healing frightening? To many, yes. For accusation is a bar to love, and
damaged bodies are accusers. They stand firmly in the way of trust and peace,
proclaiming that the frail can have no trust, and that the damaged have no
grounds for peace. Who has been injured by his brother, and could love and
trust him still? He has attacked, and will attack again. Protect him not,
because your damaged body shows that you must be protected from him. To
forgive may be an act of charity, but not his due. He may be pitied for his
guilt, but not exonerated. And if you forgive him his transgressions, you but
add to all the guilt that he has really earned. </p>

<p> The unhealed <em>cannot</em> pardon. For they are the witnesses that pardon
is unfair. They would retain the consequences of the guilt they overlook. Yet
no one can forgive a sin which he believes is real. And what has consequences
<em>must</em> be real because what it has done is there to see. Forgiveness is
not pity, which but seeks to pardon what it knows to be the truth. Good cannot
<em>be</em> returned for evil, for forgiveness does not first establish sin
and <em>then</em> forgive it. Who can say and mean, “My brother, you have
injured me, and yet, because I am the better of the two, I pardon you my
hurt”. His pardon and your hurt cannot exist together. One denies the other,
and <em>must</em> make it false.
</p>

<p> To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox which reason cannot see. For
it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it,
you grant your brother mercy, but retain the proof he is not really innocent.
The sick remain accusers. They cannot forgive their brothers and themselves as
well. For no one in whom true forgiveness reigns can suffer. He holds not the
proof of sin before his brother’s eyes. And thus he must have overlooked it,
and removed it from his own. Forgiveness cannot be for one and not the other.
Who forgives <em>is</em> healed. And in his healing lies the proof that he has
truly pardoned, and retains no trace of condemnation that he still would hold
against himself or any living thing. </p>

<p> Forgiveness is not real <em>unless</em> it brings a healing to your brother
<em>and</em> yourself. You must attest his sins had no effect on you, to
demonstrate they were not real. How else could he be guiltless? And how could
his innocence be justified unless his sins have no effect to warrant guilt?
Sins are beyond forgiveness just because they would entail effects which
cannot be undone and overlooked entirely. In their undoing lies the proof that
they were merely errors. <em>Let</em> yourself be healed, that you may be
forgiving, offering salvation to your brother and yourself. A broken body
shows the mind has not been healed. A miracle of healing proves that
separation is without effect. What you would prove to him you will believe.
The power of witness <em>comes</em> from your belief. And everything you say
or do or think but testifies to what you teach to him.
</p>

<p> Your body can be means to teach that it has never suffered pain because of
him. And in its healing can it offer him mute testimony of his innocence. It
is this testimony which can speak with power greater than a thousand tongues.
For here is his forgiveness <em>proved</em> to him. A miracle can offer
nothing less to him than it has given unto you. So does your healing show your
mind is healed, and has forgiven what he did not do. And so is he convinced
his innocence was never lost, and healed along with you. </p>

<p> Thus does the miracle undo all things the world attests can never
<em>be</em> undone. And hopelessness and death must disappear before the
ancient clarion call of life. This call has power far beyond the weak and
miserable cry of death and guilt. The ancient calling of the Father to His
Son, and of the Son unto his own, will yet be the last trumpet that the world
will ever hear. Brother, there <em>is</em> no death. And this you learn when
you but wish to show your brother that you had no hurt of him. He thinks your
blood is on his hands, and so he stands condemned. Yet it is given you to show
him, by your healing, that his guilt is but the fabric of a senseless dream.
</p>

<p> How just are miracles! For they bestow an equal gift of full deliverance
from guilt upon your brother and yourself. Your healing saves him pain as well
as you, and you are healed because you wished him well. This is the law the
miracle obeys: that healing sees no specialness at all. It does not come from
pity, but from love. And love would prove all suffering is but a vain
imagining, a foolish wish, with no effects. Your health is a result of your
desire to see your brother with no blood upon his hands, nor guilt upon his
heart made heavy with the proof of sin. And what you wish <em>is</em> given
you to see. </p>

<p>The “cost” of your serenity is his. This is the “price” the Holy Spirit and the world interpret differently. The world perceives it as a statement of the “fact” that your salvation <em>sacrifices</em> his. The Holy Spirit <em>knows</em> your healing is the witness unto his, and cannot be apart from his at all. As long as he consents to suffer, you will be unhealed. Yet you can show him that his suffering is purposeless and wholly without cause. Show him your healing, and he will consent no more to suffer. For his innocence has been established in your sight and his. And laughter will replace your sighs, because God’s Son remembered that he <em>is</em> God’s Son.</p>

<p> Who, then, fears healing? Only those to whom their brother’s sacrifice and
pain are seen to represent their own serenity. Their helplessness and weakness
represents the grounds on which they <em>justify</em> his pain. The constant
sting of guilt he suffers serves to prove that he is slave, but they are free.
The constant pain they suffer demonstrates that they are free <em>because</em>
they hold him bound. And sickness is desired to prevent a shift of balance in
the sacrifice. How could the Holy Spirit be deterred an instant, even less, to
reason with an argument for sickness such as this? And need your healing be
delayed because you pause to listen to insanity? </p>

<p> Correction is <em>not</em> your function. It belongs to One Who knows of
fairness, <em>not</em> of guilt. If you assume correction’s role, you
<em>lose</em> the function of forgiveness. No one can forgive until he learns
correction is <em>but</em> to forgive, and <em>never</em> to accuse. Alone,
you <em>cannot</em> see they are the same, and therefore is correction
<em>not</em> of you. Identity and function are the same, and <em>by</em> your
function do you know yourself. And thus, if you confuse your function with the
function of Another, you <em>must</em> be confused about yourself and who you
are. What is the separation but a wish to take God’s Function from Him and
<em>deny</em> that it is His? Yet if it is <em>not</em> His it is not
<em>yours</em>, for <em>you</em> must lose what you would take away.
</p>

<p> In a split mind, identity <em>must</em> seem to be divided. Nor can anyone
perceive a function unified which has conflicting purposes and different ends.
Correction, to a mind so split, <em>must</em> be a way to punish sins you
think are <em>yours</em> in someone else. And thus does he become your victim,
<em>not</em> your brother, <em>Different</em> from you in that he is <em>more
	guilty</em>, thus in need of your correction, as the one <em>more
	innocent</em> than he. This splits <em>his</em> function off from yours, and
gives you both a <em>different</em> role. And so you <em>cannot</em> be
perceived as one, and with a single function that would <em>mean</em> a shared
identity with but <em>one</em> end.
</p>

<p> Correction <em>you</em> would do <em>must</em> separate, because that is the
function given it <em>by</em> you. When you perceive correction is the
<em>same</em> as pardon, then you also know the Holy Spirit’s Mind and yours
are One. And so your <em>own</em> identity is found. Yet must He work with
what is <em>given</em> Him, and you allow Him only <em>half</em> your mind.
And thus He represents the <em>other</em> half, and seems to have a
<em>different</em> purpose from the one you cherish, and you <em>think</em> is
yours. Thus does your function seem <em>divided</em>, with a half <em>in
	opposition</em> to a half. And these two halves appear to represent a split
within a self perceived as two.
</p>

<p> Consider how this self-perception must extend, and do not overlook the fact
that every thought extends because that is its purpose, being what it really
<em>is</em>. From an idea of self as two, there comes a necessary view of
function split between the two. And what you would correct is only half the
error, which you think is all of it. Your brother’s sins become the central
target for correction, lest your errors and his own be seen as one. Yours are
mistakes, but his are sins, and not the same as yours. His merit punishment,
while yours, in fairness, should be overlooked.
</p>

<p>
In this interpretation of correction, your own mistakes you will not even
see. The focus of correction has been placed outside yourself, on one who
cannot be a part of you while this perception lasts. What is condemned can
never be returned to its accuser, who hated it, and hates it still. This is
your brother, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part of you, and thus outside
yourself; the other half, which is denied. And only what is left without his
presence is perceived as all of you. To this remaining half the Holy Spirit
must represent the other half until you recognise it <em>is</em> the other
half. And this He does by giving both of you a function that is one, not
different. </p>

<p>
Correction is the function given <em>both</em>, but neither one alone. And
when it is fulfilled as <em>shared</em>, it <em>must</em> correct mistakes in
both of you. It cannot leave mistakes in one unhealed, and set the other free.
That is divided purpose, which cannot be shared, and so it cannot be the
function which the Holy Spirit sees as His. And you can rest assured that He
will not fulfill a function He cannot understand and recognise as His. For
only thus can He keep yours preserved intact, despite your separate views of
what your function is. If He upheld divided function, you were lost indeed.
His inability to see His goal divided and distinct for each of you preserves
your Self from being made aware of any function other than Its Own. And thus
is healing given both of you.
</p>

<p>
Correction must be left to One Who knows correction and forgiveness are the
same. With half a mind, this is not understood. Leave, then, correction to the
Mind That <em>is</em> united, functioning as one because It is not split in
purpose, and conceives a single function as Its <em>only</em> one. Here is the
function given It conceived to be Its Own, and not apart from that Its Giver
keeps <em>because</em> it has been shared. In His acceptance of this function
lies the means whereby your mind is unified. His single purpose unifies the
halves of you which you perceive as separate. And each forgives the other,
that he may accept his other half as part of him.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">D. The Symbol of the Impossible</h2>

<p>Power cannot oppose. For opposition would weaken it, and weakened power is a contradiction in ideas. Weak strength is meaningless, and power used to  weaken is employed to limit. And therefore it must be limited and weak, because that is its purpose. Power is unopposed, to be itself. No weakness can intrude on it without changing it into something it is not. To weaken is to limit, and impose an opposite that contradicts the concept which it attacks. And by this does it join to the idea a something it is not, and make it unintelligible. Who can understand a double concept, such as “weakened-power” or as “hateful-love”?</p>

<p>You have decided that your brother is a symbol for a “hateful-love”, a “weakened-power”, and above all, a “living-death”. And so he has no meaning to you, for he stands for what is meaningless. He represents a double thought, where half is cancelled out by the remaining half. Yet even this is quickly contradicted by the half it cancelled out, and so they both are gone. And now he stands for nothing. Symbols which but represent ideas that cannot be must stand for empty space and nothingness. Yet nothingness and empty space can <em>not</em> be interference. What <em>can</em> interfere with the awareness of reality is the belief that there is something <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>The picture of your brother that you see means nothing. There is nothing to attack or to deny; to love or hate, or to endow with power or to see as weak. The picture has been wholly cancelled out, because it symbolised a contradiction which cancelled out the <em>thought</em> it represents. And thus the picture has no cause at all. Who can perceive effect without a cause? What can the causeless be but nothingness? The picture of your brother that you see is wholly absent, and has never been. Let, then, the empty space it occupies be <em>recognised</em> as vacant, and the time devoted to its seeing be perceived as idly spent, a time unoccupied.</p>

<p>
An empty space which is not seen as filled, an unused interval of time not
seen as spent and fully occupied, become a silent invitation to the truth to
enter, and to make itself at home. No preparation can be made that would
enhance the invitation’s real appeal. For what you leave as vacant God will
fill, and where He is, there <em>must</em> the truth abide. Unweakened power,
with no opposite, is what creation <em>is</em>. For this there <em>are</em> no
symbols. Nothing points beyond the truth, for what can stand for more than
everything? Yet true undoing must be kind. And so the first replacement for
your picture is another picture, of another kind.
</p>

<p>
As nothingness cannot be pictured, so there is no symbol for totality. Reality
is ultimately known without a form, unpictured and unseen. Forgiveness is not
yet a power known as wholly free of limits. Yet it sets no limits you have
chosen to impose. Forgiveness is the means by which the truth is represented
temporarily. It lets the Holy Spirit make exchange of pictures possible until
the time when aids are meaningless, and learning done. No learning aid has use
which can extend beyond the goal of learning. When its aim has been
accomplished, it is functionless. Yet in the learning interval it has a use
which now you fear, but yet will love.
</p>

<p>
The picture of your brother given you to occupy the space so lately left
unoccupied and vacant will not need defence of any kind. For you will give it
overwhelming preference. Nor delay an instant in deciding that it is the only
one you want. It does not stand for double concepts. Though it is but half the
picture, and is incomplete, within itself it is the same. The other half of
what it represents remains unknown, but is not cancelled out. And thus is God
left free to take the final step Himself. For this you need <em>no</em>
pictures and <em>no</em> learning aids. And what will ultimately take the
place of every learning aid will merely <em>be</em>. Forgiveness vanishes and
symbols fade, and nothing which the eyes have ever seen, or ears have heard,
remains to be perceived.
</p>

<p>
A Power wholly limitless has come, not to destroy, but
to receive Its Own. There is no choice of function anywhere.
The choice you fear to lose you never had. Yet only this appears
to interfere with power unlimited and single
thoughts, complete and happy, without opposite. You do not
know the peace of power which opposes nothing. Yet no
other kind can be at all. Give welcome to the Power beyond
forgiveness, and beyond the world of symbols and of limitations.
He would merely <em>be</em>, and so He merely <em>is</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">
E. The Quiet Answer
</h2>

<p>
In quietness are all things answered, and is every problem quietly resolved.
In conflict there can <em>be</em> no answer and no resolution, for its purpose
is to make no resolution possible, and to ensure no answer will be plain. A
problem set in conflict <em>has</em> no answer, for it is seen in different
ways. And what would be an answer from one point of view is not an answer in
another light. You <em>are</em> in conflict. Thus it must be clear you cannot
answer anything at all, for conflict has no limited effects. Yet if God gave
an answer, there must be a way in which your problems are resolved, for what
He wills already has been done.
</p>

<p>
Thus it must be that time is not involved, and every problem can be answered
<em>now</em>. Yet it must also be that, in your state of mind, solution is
impossible. Therefore, God must have given you a way of reaching to another
state of mind, in which the answer is already there. Such is the holy instant.
It is here that all your problems should be brought and <em>left</em>. Here
they belong, for here their answer is. And where its answer is, a problem
<em>must</em> be simple and be easily resolved. It must be pointless to
attempt to solve a problem where the answer cannot be. Yet just as surely it
must be resolved, if it is brought to where the answer <em>is</em>.
</p>

<p>
Attempt to solve no problems but within the holy instant’s surety. For there
the problem <em>will</em> be answered and resolved. Outside, there will be no
solution, for there is no answer there that could be found. Nowhere outside a
single, simple question is ever asked. The world can only ask a double
question, with many answers, none of which will do. It does not ask a question
to be answered, but only to restate its point of view. All questions asked
within this world are but a way of <em>looking</em>, not a question asked. A
question asked in hate cannot be answered, because it is an answer in itself.
A double question asks and answers, both attesting the same thing in different
form.
</p>

<p>
The world asks but <em>one</em> question. It is this: “Of these illusions,
which of them are true? Which ones establish peace and offer joy? And which
can bring escape from all the pain of which this world is made?”. Whatever
form the question takes, its purpose is the same. It asks but to establish sin
is real, and answers in the form of preference. “Which sin do you prefer? That
is the one which you should choose. The others are not true. What can the body
get that you would want the most of all? It is your servant and your friend.
But tell it what you want, and it will serve you lovingly and well”. And this
is not a question, for it tells you what you want, and where to go for it. It
leaves no room to question its beliefs, except that what it states takes
question’s <em>form</em>.
</p>

<p>
A pseudo-question has no answer. It <em>dictates</em> the answer even as it
asks. Thus is all questioning within the world a form of propaganda for
itself. Just as the body’s witnesses are but the senses from within itself, so
are the answers to the questions of the world contained within the questions.
Where answers represent the questions they add nothing new, and nothing has
been learned.
</p>

<p>
An honest question is a learning tool which asks for something that you do
<em>not</em> know. It does not set conditions for response, but merely asks
what the response should be. But no one in a conflict state is free to ask
this question, for he does not want an honest answer, where the conflict ends.
Only within the holy instant can an honest question honestly be asked. And
from the meaning of the question does the meaningfulness of the answer come.
Here is it possible to separate your wishes from the answer, so it can be
given you, and also be <em>received</em>. The answer is provided everywhere.
Yet it is only here it can be <em>heard</em>.
</p>

<p>An honest answer asks no sacrifice because it answers questions truly asked. The questions of the world but ask of whom is sacrifice demanded, asking not if sacrifice is meaningful at all. And so <em>unless</em> the answer tells “of whom” it will remain unrecognised, unheard, and thus the question is preserved intact because it gave the answer to itself. The holy instant is the interval in which the mind is still enough to hear an answer which is not entailed within the question asked. It offers something new and different from the question. How could it be answered if it but repeats itself?</p>

<p>
Therefore, attempt to solve no problems in a world from which the answer has
been barred. But bring the problem to the only place which holds the answer
lovingly for you. Here are the answers which will solve your problems because
they stand apart from them, and see what <em>can</em> be answered; what the
question <em>is</em>. Within the world the answers merely raise another
question, though they leave the first unanswered. In the holy instant, you can
bring the question to the answer, and receive the answer that was made
<em>for</em> you.
</p>

<h2 id="s6">
F. The Healing Example
</h2>

<p>
The only way to heal is to be healed. The miracle extends without your help,
but you <em>are</em> needed that it can begin. Accept the miracle of healing,
and it will go forth because of what it <em>is</em>. It is its nature to
extend itself the instant it is born. And it is born the instant it is offered
and <em>received</em>. No one can ask another to be healed. But he can let
<em>himself</em> be healed, and thus offer the other what he has received. Who
can bestow upon another what he does not have? And who can share what he
denies himself? The Holy Spirit speaks to <em>you</em>. He does not speak to
someone else. Yet by your listening, His Voice extends because you have
<em>accepted</em> what He says.
</p>

<p>
Health is the witness unto health. As long as it is unattested, it remains
without conviction. Only when demonstrated has it been proved, and
<em>must</em> compel belief. No one is healed through double messages. If you
wish only to be healed, you heal. Your <em>single</em> purpose makes this
possible. But if you are afraid of healing, then it cannot come through you.
The only thing that is required for a healing is a lack of fear. The fearful
are not healed, and cannot heal. This does not mean the conflict must be gone
forever from your mind. For if it were, there were no need for healing then.
But it <em>does</em> mean, if only for an instant, you love without attack. An
instant is sufficient. Miracles wait not on time.
</p>

<p>
The holy instant is the miracle’s abiding-place. From there, each one is born
into this world as witness to a state of mind which has transcended conflict,
and has reached to peace. It carries comfort from the place of peace into the
battle-ground, and demonstrates that war has no effects. For all the hurt that
war has sought to bring, the broken bodies and the shattered limbs, the
screaming dying and the silent dead, are gently lifted up and comforted. There
<em>is</em> no sadness where a miracle has come to heal. And nothing more than
just <em>one</em> instant of your love without attack is necessary, that all
this occur. In that one instant are you healed, and in that single instant is
all healing done.
</p>

<p>
What stands apart from you, when you accept the blessing that the holy instant
brings? Be not afraid of blessing, for the One Who blesses you loves all the
world, and leaves nothing within the world that could be feared. But if you
shrink from blessing, will the world indeed seem fearful, for you have
withheld its peace and comfort, leaving it to die. Would not a world so
bitterly bereft be looked on as a condemnation by the one who could have saved
it, but stepped back because he was afraid of being healed? The eyes of all
the dying bring reproach, and suffering whispers, “What is there to fear?”.
Consider well its question. It is asked of you on your behalf. A dying world
asks only that you rest an instant from attack upon yourself, that it be
healed.
</p>

<p>
Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there received is
left behind, on your returning to the world. And being blessed, you will bring
blessing. Life is given you to give the dying world. And suffering eyes no
longer will accuse, but shine in thanks to you who blessing gave. The holy
instant’s radiance will light your eyes, and give them sight to see beyond all
suffering, and see Christ’s face instead. Healing <em>replaces</em> suffering.
Who looks on one cannot perceive the other, for they cannot both be there. And
what you see the world will witness, and will witness <em>to</em>.
</p>

<p>
Thus is your healing everything the world requires, that it may be healed. It
needs <em>one</em> lesson which has perfectly been learned. And then, when you
forget it, will the world remind you gently of what you have taught. No
reïnforcement will its thanks withhold from you who let yourself be healed
that it might live. It will call forth its witnesses to show the face of
Christ to you who brought the sight to them, by which they witnessed it. The
world of accusation is replaced by one in which all eyes look lovingly upon
the Friend who brought them their release. And happily your brother will
perceive the many friends he thought were enemies.
</p>

<p>
Problems are not specific, but they take specific forms, and these specific
shapes make up the world. And no one understands the nature of his problem. If
he did, it would be there no more for him to see. Its very nature is that it
is <em>not</em>. And thus, while he perceives it, he can <em>not</em> perceive
it as it is. But healing is apparent in specific instances, and generalises to
include them all. This is because they really are the same, despite their
different forms. All learning aims at transfer, which becomes complete within
two situations which are seen as one, for <em>only</em> common elements are
there. Yet this can only be attained by One Who does not see the differences
you see. The total transfer of your learning is not made by you. But that it
has been made in spite of all the differences you see, convinces you that they
could not be real.
</p>

<p>
Your healing will extend, and will be brought to problems that you thought
were not your own. And it will also be apparent that your many different
problems will be solved, as any one of them has been escaped. It cannot be
their differences which made this possible, for learning does not jump from
situations to their opposites, and bring the same results. All healing must
proceed in lawful manner, in accord with laws which have been properly
perceived, but never violated. Fear you not the way that you perceive them.
You are wrong, but there is One within you Who is <em>right</em>.
</p>

<p>
Leave, then, the transfer of your learning to the One Who really understands
its laws, and Who will guarantee that they remain unviolated and unlimited.
Your part is merely to apply what He has taught you to <em>yourself</em>, and
He will do the rest. And thus the power of your learning will be proved to you
by all the many different witnesses it finds. Your brother first among them
will be seen, but thousands stand behind him, and beyond each one there are a
thousand more. Each one may seem to have a problem which is different from the
rest. Yet they are solved together. And their common answer shows the
questions could not have been separate.
</p>

<p>
Peace be to you to whom is healing offered. And you will learn that peace is
given you when you accept the healing for yourself. Its total value need not
be appraised by you to let you understand that you have benefited from it.
What occurred within the instant which love entered in without attack will
stay with you forever. Your healing will be one of its effects, as will your
brother’s. Everywhere you go will you behold its multiplied effects. Yet all
the witnesses that you behold will be far less than all there really are.
Infinity cannot be understood by merely counting up its separate parts. God
thanks you for your healing, for He knows it is a gift of love unto His Son,
and therefore is it given unto Him.
</p>

<h2 id="s7">
G. The Purpose of Pain
</h2>

<p>
Pain demonstrates the body must be real. It is a loud, obscuring voice whose
shrieks would silence what the Holy Spirit says, and keep His words from your
awareness. Pain compels attention, drawing it away from Him, and focusing upon
itself. Its purpose is the same as pleasure, for they both are means to make
the body real. What shares a common purpose is the same. This is the law of
purpose, which unites all those who share in it within itself. Pleasure and
pain are equally unreal, because their purpose cannot <em>be</em> achieved.
Thus are they means for nothing, for they have a goal without a meaning. And
they share the lack of meaning which their purpose has.
</p>

<p>
Sin shifts from pain to pleasure, and again to pain. For either witness is the
same, and carries but one message: “You are here, within this body, and you
can be hurt. You can have pleasure, too, but only at the cost of pain”. These
witnesses are joined by many more. Each one seems different because it has a
different name, and so it seems to answer to a different sound. Except for
this, the witnesses of sin are all alike. Call pleasure pain, and it will
hurt. Call pain a pleasure, and the pain behind the pleasure will be felt no
more. Sin’s witnesses but shift from name to name, as one steps forward and
another back. Yet which is foremost makes no difference. Sin’s witnesses hear
but the call of death.
</p>

<p>
This body, purposeless within itself, holds all your memories and all your
hopes. You use its eyes to see, its ears to hear, and let it tell you what it
is it feels. <em>It does not</em> <em>know</em>. It tells you but the names
you gave it to use, when <em>you</em> call forth the witnesses to its reality.
You cannot choose among them which are real, for any one you choose is like
the rest. This name or that, but nothing more, you choose. You do not make a
witness true because you called him by truth’s name. The truth is found in him
if it is truth he <em>represents</em>. And otherwise he lies, if you should
call him by the holy Name of God Himself.
</p>

<p>
God’s Witness sees no witnesses <em>against</em> the body. Neither does He
harken to the witnesses by other names which speak in other ways for its
reality. He <em>knows</em> it is not real. For nothing could contain what you
believe it holds within. Nor could it tell a part of God Himself what it
should feel, and what its function is. Yet must He love whatever you hold
dear. And for each witness to the body’s death He sends a witness to your life
in Him Who knows no death. Each miracle He brings is witness that the body is
not real. Its pains and pleasures does He heal alike, for <em>all</em> sin’s
witnesses do His replace.
</p>

<p>
The miracle makes no distinctions in the names by which sin’s witnesses are
called. It merely proves that what they represent has no effects. And this it
proves because its own effects have come to take their place. It matters not
the name by which you called your suffering. It is no longer there. The One
Who brings the miracle perceived them all as one, and called by name of
‘fear’. As fear is witness unto death, so is the miracle the witness unto
life. It is a witness no one can deny, for it is the <em>effects</em> of life
it brings. The dying live, the dead arise, and pain has vanished. Yet a
miracle speaks not but for itself, but what it represents.
</p>

<p>
Love, too, has symbols in a world of sin. The miracle forgives because it
stands for what is past forgiveness, and is true. How foolish and insane it is
to think a miracle is bound by laws which it came solely to undo! The laws of
sin have different witnesses, with different strengths. And they attest to
different sufferings. Yet to the One Who sends forth miracles to bless the
world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly pleasure, and the throes of death
itself, are but a single sound; a call for healing, and a plaintive cry for
help within a world of misery. It is their <em>sameness</em> that the miracle
attests. It is their sameness that it <em>proves</em>.
</p>

<p>
The laws which call them different are dissolved, and <em>shown</em> as
powerless. The purpose of a miracle is to accomplish this. And God Himself has
guaranteed the strength of miracles for what they witness to. Be witnesses
unto the miracle, and not the laws of sin. There is no need to suffer any
more. But there <em>is</em> need that you be healed, because the suffering of
the world has made it deaf to its salvation and deliverance.
</p>

<p>
The resurrection of the world awaits your healing and your happiness, that you
may demonstrate the healing of the world. The holy instant will replace all
sin, if you but carry its effects with you. And no one will elect to suffer
more. What better function could you serve than this? Be healed that you may
heal, and suffer not the laws of sin to be applied to you. And truth will be
revealed to you who chose to let love’s symbols take the place of sin.
</p>

<h2 id="s8">
H. The Illusion of Suffering
</h2>

<p>Suffering is an emphasis upon all that the world has done to injure you. Here is the world’s demented version of salvation clearly shown. Like to a dream of punishment, in which the dreamer is unconscious of what brought on the attack against himself, he sees himself attacked unjustly, and by something not himself. He is the victim of this “something else”, a thing outside himself, for which he has no reason to be held responsible. He must be innocent because he knows not what he does, but what is done to him. Yet is his own attack upon himself apparent still, for it is he who bears the suffering. And he cannot escape because its source is seen outside himself.</p>

<p>
Now you are being shown you <em>can</em> escape. All that is needed is you
look upon the problem as it <em>is</em>, and not the way that you have set it
up. How could there be another way to solve a problem which is very simple,
but has been obscured by heavy clouds of complication, which were made to
<em>keep</em> the problem unresolved? Without the clouds, the problem will
emerge in all its primitive simplicity. The choice will not be difficult,
because the problem is absurd when clearly seen. No one has difficulty making
up his mind to let a simple problem be resolved if it is <em>seen</em> as
hurting him, and also very easily removed.
</p>

<p>The “reasoning” by which the world is made, on which it rests, by which it is maintained, is simply this: “<em>You</em> are the cause of what I do. Your presence <em>justifies</em> my wrath, and you exist and think <em>apart</em> from me. While you attack, I must be innocent. And what I suffer from <em>is</em> your attack”. No one who looks upon this “reasoning” exactly as it is could fail to see it does not follow, and it makes no sense. Yet it seems sensible because it <em>looks</em> as if the world were hurting you. And so it seems as if there is no need to go beyond the obvious in terms of cause. </p>

<p>
There is <em>indeed</em> a need. The world’s escape from condemnation is a
need which those within the world are joined in sharing. Yet they do not
recognise their common need. For each one thinks that if he does his part, the
condemnation of the world will rest on him. And it is this that he perceives
to <em>be</em> his part in its deliverance. Vengeance must have a focus.
Otherwise is the avenger’s knife in his own hand, and pointed to himself. And
he must see it in another’s hand, if he would be a victim of attack he did not
choose. And thus he suffers from the wounds a knife he does not hold has made
upon himself. This is the <em>purpose</em> of the world he sees. And looked at
thus, the world provides the means by which this purpose seems to be
fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
The means <em>attest</em> the purpose, but are not themselves a cause. Nor
will the cause be changed by seeing it apart from its effects. The cause
<em>produces</em> the effects, which then bear witness to the cause, and not
themselves. Look, then, beyond effects. It is not here the cause of suffering
and sin must lie. And dwell not on the suffering and sin, for they are but
reflections of their cause.
</p>

<p>
The part you play in salvaging the world from condemnation is your
<em>own</em> escape. Forget not that the witness to the world of evil cannot
speak except for what has seen a need for evil in the world. And this is where
your guilt was first beheld. In separation from your brother was the first
attack upon yourself begun. And it is this the world bears witness to. Seek
not another cause, nor look among the mighty legions of its witnesses for its
undoing. They <em>support</em> its claim on your allegiance. What conceals the
truth is not where you should look to <em>find</em> the truth. The witnesses
to sin all stand within one little space. And it is <em>here</em> you find the
cause of your perspective on the world.
</p>

<p>
Once you were unaware of what the cause of everything the world appeared to
thrust upon you, uninvited and
unasked, must really be. Of one thing you were sure; of all the many causes
you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among
them. Nor did you, in any way, request them for yourself. This is how
<em>all</em> illusions come about. The one who makes them does not see himself
as making them, and their reality does not depend on him. Whatever cause they
have is something quite apart from him, and what he sees is <em>separate</em>
from his mind. He cannot doubt his dreams’ reality because he does not see the
part he plays in making them, and making them seem real.
</p>

<p>
No one can waken from a dream the world is dreaming <em>for</em> him. He
becomes a part of someone else’s dream. He cannot choose to waken from a dream
he did not make. Helpless he stands, a victim to a dream conceived and
cherished by a separate mind. Careless indeed of him this mind must be, as
thoughtless of his peace and happiness as is the weather, or the time of day.
It loves him not, but casts him as it will, in any role that satisfies its
dream. So little is his worth that he is but a dancing shadow, leaping up and
down according to a senseless plot conceived within the idle dreaming of the
world.
</p>

<p>
This is the only picture you can see, the one alternative that you can choose,
the other possibility of cause, if you be <em>not</em> the dreamer of your
dreams. And this is what you choose, if you deny the cause of suffering is in
<em>your</em> mind. Be glad indeed it is, for thus are you the <em>one</em>
decider of your destiny in time. The choice is yours to make between a
sleeping death and dreams of evil or a happy wakening and joy of life. What
could you choose between <em>but</em> life or death, waking or sleeping, peace
or war, your dreams or your reality? Yet if the choice is really given you,
then you must see the causes of the things you choose between exactly
<em>as</em> they are and <em>where</em> they are. What choices can be made
between two states, but one of which is clearly recognised? Who could be free
to choose between effects, when only one is seen as up to him?
</p>

<p>
An honest choice could never be perceived as one in which the choice is split
between a tiny you and an enormous world, with different dreams about the
truth in you. The gap between reality and dreams lies not between the dreaming
of the world and what you dream in secret. <em>They</em> are one. The dreaming
of the world is but a part of your own dream you gave away, and saw as if it
were its start and ending, both. Yet was it started by <em>your</em> secret
dream, which you do not perceive, although it caused the part you see and do
not doubt is real. How could you doubt it while you lie asleep, and dream in
secret that its cause is real?
</p>

<p>
A brother separated from yourself, an ancient enemy, a murderer who stalks you
in the night and plots your death, yet plans that it be lingering and slow; of
this you dream. Yet underneath this dream is yet another, in which you become
the murderer, the secret enemy, the scavenger and the destroyer of your
brother and the world alike. Here is the <em>cause</em> of suffering, the
space between your dreams and your reality. The little gap you do not even
see, the birthplace of illusions and of fear, the time of terror and of
ancient hate, the instant of disaster, all are here. Here is the
<em>cause</em> of unreality. And it is here that it will be undone.
</p>

<p>
<em>You</em> are the dreamer of the world of dreams. No other cause it has,
nor ever will. Nothing more fearful than an idle dream has terrified God’s
Son, and made him think that he has lost his innocence, denied his Father, and
made war upon himself. So fearful is the dream, so seeming real, he could not
waken to reality without the sweat of terror and a scream of mortal fear,
unless a gentler dream preceded his awaking, and allowed his calmer mind to
welcome, not to fear, the Voice that calls with love to waken him. A gentler
dream, in which his suffering was healed, and where his brother was his
friend. God willed he waken gently, and with joy. And gave him means to waken
without fear. Accept the dream He gave instead of yours. It is not difficult
to change a dream when once the dreamer has been recognised.
</p>

<p>
Rest in the Holy Spirit, and allow His gentle dreams to take the place of
those you dreamed in terror, and in fear of death. He brings forgiving dreams,
in which the choice is not who is the murderer and who shall be the victim. In
the dreams He brings, there <em>is</em> no murder and there <em>is</em> no
death. The dream of guilt is fading from your sight, although your eyes are
closed. A smile has come to lighten up your sleeping face. The sleep is
peaceful now, for these are happy dreams.
</p>

<p>
Dream softly of your sinless brother, who unites with you in holy innocence.
And from this dream, the Lord of Heaven will Himself awaken His beloved Son.
Dream of your brother’s kindnesses instead of dwelling in your dreams on his
mistakes. Select his thoughtfulness to dream about instead of counting up the
hurts he gave. Forgive him his illusions, and give thanks to him for all the
helpfulness he gave. And do not brush aside his many gifts because he is not
perfect in your dreams.
</p>

<p>
He represents his Father, Whom you see as offering both life and death to you.
Brother, He gives but life. Yet what you see as gifts your brother offers
represent the gifts you dream your Father gives to you. Let all your brother’s
gifts be seen in light of charity and kindness offered you. And let no pain
disturb your dream of deep appreciation for his gifts to you.
</p>

<h2 id="s9">
I. The “Hero” of the Dream
</h2>

<p>
The body is the central figure in the dreaming of the world. There is no dream
without it, nor does it exist without the dream in which it acts as if it were
a person, to be seen and be believed. It takes the central place in every
dream, which tells the story of how it was made by other bodies, born into the
world outside the body, lives a little while, and dies, to be united in the
dust with other bodies dying like itself. In the brief time allotted it to
live, it seeks for other bodies as its friends and enemies. Its safety is its
main concern. Its comfort is its guiding rule. It tries to look for pleasure,
and avoid the things that would be hurtful. Above all, it tries to teach
itself its pains and joys are different, and can be told apart.
</p>

<p>
The dreaming of the world takes many forms, because the body seeks in many
ways to prove it is autonomous and real. It puts things on itself which it has
bought with little metal discs or paper strips the world proclaims as valuable
and good. It works to get them, doing senseless things, and tosses them away
for senseless things it does not need, and does not even want. It hires other
bodies, that they may protect it, and collect more senseless things that it
can call its own. It looks about for special bodies which can share its dream.
Sometimes it dreams it is a conqueror of bodies weaker than itself. But in
some phases of the dream, it is the slave of bodies that would hurt and
torture it.
</p>

<p>The body’s serial adventures, from the time of birth to dying is the theme of every dream the world has ever had. The “hero” of this dream will never change, nor will its purpose. Though the dream itself takes many forms, and seems to show a great variety of places and events whereïn its “hero” finds itself, the dream has but one purpose, taught in many ways. This single lesson does it try to teach again, and still again, and yet once more: that it is <em>cause</em> and <em>not</em> effect. And <em>you</em> are its effect, and <em>cannot</em> be its cause.</p>

<p>
Thus are you not the dreamer, but the <em>dream</em>. And so you wander idly
in and out of places and events which <em>it</em> contrives. That this is all
the body does is true, for it <em>is</em> but a figure in a dream. But who
reäcts to figures in a dream unless he sees them as if they were real? The
instant that he sees them as they <em>are</em>, they have no more effects on
him because he understands he <em>gave</em> them their effects by causing
them, and making them seem real.
</p>

<p>
How willing are you to escape effects of all the dreams the world has ever
had? Is it your wish to let no dream appear to be the cause of what it is you
do? Then let us merely look upon the dream’s beginning, for the part you see
is but the second part, whose cause lies in the first. No one asleep and
dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon himself. No one believes there
really was a time when he knew nothing of a body, and could never have
conceived this world as real. He would have seen at once that these ideas are
one illusion, too ridiculous for anything but to be laughed away. How serious
they now appear to be! And no one can remember when they would have met with
laughter and with disbelief.
</p>

<p>
We <em>can</em> remember this, if we but look directly at their cause. And we
will see the grounds for laughter, not a cause for fear. Let us return the
dream he gave away unto the dreamer, who perceives the dream as separate from
himself, and done to him. Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny,
mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh. In his forgetting
did the thought become a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and
real effects. Together, we can laugh them both away, and understand that time
cannot intrude upon eternity. It <em>is</em> a joke to think that time can
come to circumvent eternity, which <em>means</em> there is no time.
</p>

<p>
A timelessness in which is time made real; a part of God which can attack
itself; a separate brother as an enemy; a mind within a body, all are forms of
circularity, whose ending starts at its beginning, ending at its cause. The
world you see depicts exactly what you thought you did. Except that now you
think that what you did is being done to you. The guilt for what you thought
is being placed outside yourself, and on a guilty world which dreams your
dreams and thinks your thoughts instead of you. It brings its vengeance, not
your own. It keeps you narrowly confined within a body, which it punishes
because of all the sinful things the body does within its dream. You have no
power to make the body stop its evil deeds, because you did not make it, and
cannot control its actions or its purpose or its fate.
</p>

<p>
The world but demonstrates an ancient truth; you will believe that others do
to you <em>exactly</em> what you think you did to them. But once deluded into
blaming them, you will not see the cause of what they do because you
<em>want</em> the guilt to rest on them. How childish is this petulant device
to keep your innocence by pushing guilt outside yourself, but never letting
go! It is not easy to perceive the jest when all around you do your eyes
behold its heavy consequences, but without their trifling cause. Without the
cause do its effects seem serious and sad indeed. Yet they but follow. And it
is their <em>cause</em> which follows nothing, and is but a jest.
</p>

<p>
In gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause, and looks not to
effects. How else could He correct your error, who have overlooked the cause
entirely? He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him, that you may look
together on its foolish cause, and laugh with Him a while. <em>You</em> judge
effects, but <em>He</em> has judged their cause. And by His judgement are
effects removed. Perhaps you come in tears, but hear Him say, “My brother,
Holy Son of God, behold your idle dream, in which this could occur”, and you
will leave the holy instant with your laughter and your brother’s joined with
His.
</p>

<p>
The secret of salvation is but this: That <em>you</em> are doing this unto
yourself. No matter what the form of the attack, this still is true. Whoëver
takes the role of enemy and of attacker, still is this the truth. Whatever
seems to be the cause of any pain and suffering you feel, this is still true.
For you would not reäct at all to figures in a dream you knew that
<em>you</em> were dreaming. Let them be as hateful and as vicious as they may,
they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognise it is
<em>your</em> dream. This single lesson learned will set you free from
suffering, whatever form it takes.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit will repeat this one inclusive lesson of deliverance until it
has been learned, regardless of the form of suffering that brings you pain.
Whatever hurt you bring to Him He will make answer with this very simple
truth. For this one answer takes away the <em>cause</em> of every form of
sorrow and of pain. The form affects His answer not at all, for He would teach
you but the single cause of all of them, no matter what their form. And you
will understand that miracles reflect the simple statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I have done this thing, and it is this I would undo”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Bring, then, all forms of suffering to Him Who knows that every one is like
the rest. He sees no differences where none exist, and He will teach you how
each one is caused. None has a different cause from all the rest, and all of
them are easily undone by but a single lesson truly learned. Salvation is a
secret you have kept but from yourself. The universe proclaims it so. Yet to
its witnesses you pay no heed at all. For they attest the thing you do not
<em>want</em> to know. They seem to keep it secret from you. Yet you need but
learn you choose but <em>not</em> to listen, <em>not</em> to see. How
differently will you perceive the world when this is recognised! When you
forgive the world your guilt, <em>you</em> will be free of it. Its innocence
does <em>not</em> demand your guilt, nor does <em>your</em> guiltlessness rest
on its sins.
</p>

<p>
This is the obvious; a secret kept from no one but yourself. And it is this
that has maintained you separate from the world, and kept your brother
separate from you. Now need you but to learn that <em>both</em> of you are
innocent or guilty. The one thing that is impossible is that you be unlike
each other; that they <em>both</em> be true. This is the only secret yet to
learn. And it will be no secret you are healed.
</p>
