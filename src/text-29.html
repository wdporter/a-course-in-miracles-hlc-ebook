<h2 id="s1">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
	There is no time, no place, no state where God is absent. There is nothing to
	be feared. There is no way in which a gap could be conceived of in the
	wholeness that is His. The compromise the least and littlest gap would
	represent in His eternal Love is quite impossible. For it would mean His Love
	could harbour just a hint of hate; His gentleness turn sometimes to attack;
	and His eternal patience sometimes fail. All this do you believe, when you
	perceive a gap between your brother and yourself. How could you trust Him,
	then? For He must be deceptive in His Love. Be wary, then; let Him not come
	too close, and leave a gap between you and His Love, through which you can
	escape if there be need for you to flee.
</p>

<p>
	Here is the fear of God most plainly seen. For love <em>is</em> treacherous to
	those who fear, since fear and hate can never be apart. No one who hates but
	is afraid of love, and therefore <em>must</em> he be afraid of God. Certain it
	is he knows not what love means. He fears to love and loves to hate, and so he
	thinks that love is fearful; hate is love. This is the consequence the little
	gap must bring to those who cherish it, and think that it is their salvation
	and their hope.
</p>

<p>
	The fear of God! The greatest obstacle that peace must flow across has not yet
	gone. The rest are past, but this one still remains to block your path, and
	make the way to light seem dark and fearful, perilous and bleak. You had
	decided that your brother is your enemy. Sometimes a friend, perhaps, provided
	that your separate interests made your friendship possible a little while. But
	not without a gap between you, lest he turn again into an enemy. Let him come
	close to you, and you jumped back; as you approached, he instantly withdrew. A
	cautious friendship, limited in scope and carefully restricted in amount,
	became the treaty you had made with him. You shared a qualified entente, in
	which a clause of separation was a point on which you both agreed to keep
	intact. And violating this was thought to be a breach of treaty not to be
	allowed.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">
	B. The Closing of the Gap
</h2>

<p>
	The gap between you is not one of space between two separate bodies. This but
	seems to be dividing off your separate minds. It is the symbol of a promise
	made to meet when you prefer, and separate until you both elect to meet again.
	And then your bodies seem to get in touch, and signify a meeting place to
	join. But always is it possible to go your separate ways. Conditional upon the
	‘right’ to separate will you agree to meet from time to time, and keep apart
	in intervals of separation, which protect you from the ‘sacrifice’ of love.
	The body <em>saves</em> you, for it gets away from total sacrifice, and gives
	you time in which to build again your separate selves, which you believe
	diminish as you meet.
</p>

<p>
	The body <em>could</em> not separate your minds unless you wanted it to be a
	cause of separation and of distance seen between you. Thus do you endow it
	with a power that lies not within itself. And hereïn lies its power over
	<em>you</em>. For now you think that it determines when you meet, and limits
	your ability to make communion with each other’s mind. And now it tells you
	where to go and how to go there, what is feasible for you to undertake, and
	what you cannot do. It dictates what its health can tolerate, and what will
	tire it and make it sick. And its ‘inherent’ weaknesses set up the limitations
	on what you would do, and keep your purpose limited and weak.
</p>

<p>
	The body <em>will</em> accommodate to this, if you would have it so. It will
	allow but limited indulgences in ‘love’, with intervals of hatred in between.
	And it will take command of when to ‘love’ and when to shrink more safely into
	fear. It will be sick because you do not know what loving means. And so you
	<em>must</em> misuse each circumstance and everyone you meet, and see in them
	a purpose not your own.
</p>

<p>
	It is not love that asks a sacrifice. But fear <em>demands</em> the sacrifice
	of love, for in love’s presence fear cannot abide. For hate to be maintained
	love <em>must</em> be feared, and only sometimes present; sometimes gone. Thus
	is love seen as treacherous, because it seems to come and go uncertainly, and
	offer no stability to you. You do not see how limited and weak is your
	allegiance, and how frequently you have demanded that love go away, and leave
	you quietly alone, in ‘peace’.
</p>

<p>
	The body, innocent of any goal, is your excuse for variable goals <em>you</em>
	hold, and force the body to maintain. You do not fear its weakness, but its
	lack of strength <em>or</em> weakness. Would you recognise that nothing stands
	between you? Would you know there <em>is</em> no gap behind which you can
	hide? There is a shock that comes to those who learn their Saviour is their
	enemy no more. There is a wariness that is aroused by learning that the body
	is not real. And there are overtones of seeming fear around the happy message
	‘God is love’.
</p>

<p>
	Yet all that happens when the gap is gone is peace eternal. Nothing more than
	that, and nothing less. Without the fear of God, what could induce you to
	abandon Him? What toys or trinkets in the gap could serve to hold you back an
	instant from His love? Would you allow the body to say ‘no’ to Heaven’s
	calling, were you not afraid to find a loss of self in finding God? Yet
	<em>can</em> your Self be lost by being found?
</p>

<h2 id="s3">
	C. The Coming of the Guest
</h2>

<p>
	Why would you not perceive it as release from suffering to learn that you are
	free? Why would you not acclaim the truth, instead of looking on it as an
	enemy? Why does an easy path, so clearly marked it is impossible to lose the
	way, seem thorny, rough, and far too difficult for you to follow? Is it not
	because you see it as the road to hell, instead of looking on it as a simple
	way, without a sacrifice or any loss, to find yourself in Heaven and in God?
	Until you realise you give up nothing, until you understand there <em>is</em>
	no loss, you will have some regrets about the way that you have chosen. And
	you will not see the many gains your choice has offered you. Yet though you do
	not see them, they are there. Their <em>cause</em> has been effected, and they
	must be present where their cause has entered in.
</p>

<p>
	You have accepted healing’s cause, and so it must be you are healed. And being
	healed, the power to heal must also now be yours. The miracle is not a
	separate thing which happens suddenly, as an effect without a cause. Nor is
	it, in itself, a cause. But where its cause is must it be. Now is it caused,
	though not as yet perceived. And its effects are there, though not yet seen.
	Look inward now, and you will not behold a reason for regret, but cause indeed
	for glad rejoicing and for hope of peace.
</p>

<p>
	It <em>has</em> been hopeless to attempt to find the hope of peace upon a
	battleground. It <em>has</em> been futile to demand escape from sin and pain
	of what was made to serve the function of <em>retaining</em> sin and pain. For
	pain and sin are one illusion, as are hate and fear, attack and guilt but one.
	Where they are causeless their effects are gone, and love must come whereëver
	they are not. Why are you not rejoicing? You are free of pain and sickness,
	misery and loss, and all effects of hatred and attack. No more is pain your
	friend and guilt your god, and you should welcome the effects of love.
</p>

<p>
	Your Guest <em>has</em> come. You asked Him, and He came. You did not hear Him
	enter, for you did not wholly welcome Him. And yet His gifts came with Him. He
	has laid them at your feet, and asks you now that you will look on them, and
	take them for your own. He <em>needs</em> your help in giving them to all who
	walk apart, believing they are separate and alone. They will be healed when
	you accept your gifts, because your Guest will welcome everyone whose feet
	have touched the holy ground whereön you stand, and where His gifts for them
	are laid.
</p>

<p>
	You do not see how much you now can give, because of everything you have
	received. Yet He Who entered in but waits for <em>you</em> to come where you
	invited Him to be. There is no other place where He can find His host, nor
	where His host can meet with Him. And nowhere else His gifts of peace and joy,
	and all the happiness His Presence brings, can be obtained. For they are where
	He is Who brought them with Him, that they might be yours. You cannot see your
	Guest, but you <em>can</em> see the gifts He brought. And when you look on
	them, you will believe His Presence must be there. For what you now can do
	could not be done without the love and grace His Presence holds.
</p>

<p>
	Such is the promise of the living God: His Son have life and every living
	thing be part of him, and nothing else have life. What <em>you</em> have given
	‘life’ is not alive, and symbolises but your wish to be alive apart from life,
	alive in death, with death perceived as life, and living, death. Confusion
	follows on confusion here, for on confusion has this world been based, and
	there is nothing else it rests upon. Its basis does not change, although it
	seems to be in constant change. Yet what is that except the state confusion
	really means? Stability to those who are confused is meaningless, and shift
	and change become the law on which they predicate their lives.
</p>

<p>
	The body does not change. It represents the larger dream that change is
	possible. To change is to attain a state unlike the one in which you found
	yourself before. There <em>is</em> no change in immortality, and Heaven knows
	it not. Yet here on earth it has a double purpose, for it can be made to teach
	opposing things. And they reflect the teacher who is teaching them. The body
	can <em>appear</em> to change with time, with sickness or with health, and
	with events that seem to alter it. Yet this but means the mind remains
	unchanged in its belief of what the purpose of the body is.
</p>

<p>
	Sickness is a demand the body be a thing that it is not. Its nothingness is
	guarantee that it can <em>not</em> be sick. In your demand that it be more
	than this lies the idea of sickness. For it asks that God be less than all He
	really is. What, then, becomes of you, for it <em>is</em> you of whom the
	sacrifice is asked? For He is told that part of Him belongs to Him no longer.
	He must sacrifice your self, and in His sacrifice are you made more, and He is
	lessened by the loss of you. And what is gone from Him becomes your god,
	protecting you from being part of Him.
</p>

<p>
	The body that is asked to be a god will be attacked, because its nothingness
	has not been recognised. And so it seems to be a thing with power in itself.
	As ‘something’, it can be perceived and thought to feel and act, and hold you
	in its grasp as prisoner to itself. And it can fail to be what you demanded
	that it be. And you will hate it for its littleness, unmindful that the
	failure does not lie in that it is not more than it should be, but only in
	your failure to perceive that it is nothing. Yet its nothingness is your
	salvation, from which you would flee.
</p>

<p>
	As ‘something’ is the body asked to be God’s enemy, replacing what He is with
	littleness and limit and despair. It is His loss you celebrate when you behold
	the body as a thing you love, or look upon it as a thing you hate. For if He
	be the sum of everything, then what is not in Him does not exist, and His
	completion <em>is</em> its nothingness. Your Saviour is not dead, nor does he
	dwell in what was built as temple unto death. He lives in God, and it is this
	that makes him Saviour unto you, and <em>only</em> this. His body’s
	nothingness releases yours from sickness and from death. For what is yours
	cannot be more nor less than what is his.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">
	D. God’s Witnesses
</h2>

<p>
	Condemn your Saviour not because he thinks he is a body. For beyond his dreams
	is his reality. But he must learn he is a Saviour first, before he can
	remember what he is. And he must save who would be saved. On saving you
	depends his happiness. For who is Saviour but the one who <em>gives</em>
	salvation? Thus he learns it must be his to give. Unless he gives, he will not
	know he has, for giving is the <em>proof</em> of having. Only those who think
	that God is lessened by their strength could fail to understand this must be
	so. For who <em>could</em> give unless he has, and who could lose by giving
	what must be <em>increased</em> thereby?
</p>

<p>
	Think you the Father lost Himself when He created you? Was He made weak
	because He shared His love? Was He made incomplete by your perfection? Or are
	you the <em>proof</em> that He is perfect and complete? Deny Him not His
	witness in the dream His Son prefers to his reality. He must be Saviour
	<em>from</em> the dream he made, that he be free of it. He must see someone
	else as <em>not</em> a body, one with him, without the wall the world has
	built to keep apart all living things who know not that they live. Within the
	dream of bodies and of death is yet one theme of truth; no more, perhaps, than
	just a tiny spark, a space of light created in the dark, where God still
	shines.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot wake yourself. Yet you can <em>let</em> yourself be wakened. You
	can overlook your brother’s dreams. So perfectly can you forgive him his
	illusions, he becomes your Saviour from your dreams. And as you see him
	shining in the space of light where God abides within the darkness, you will
	see that God Himself is where his body is. Before this light the body
	disappears, as heavy shadows must give way to light. The darkness cannot
	choose that it remain. The coming of the light <em>means</em> it is gone. In
	glory will you see your brother then, and understand what <em>really</em>
	fills the gap so long perceived as keeping you apart.
</p>

<p>
	There, in its place, God’s Witness has set forth the gentle way of kindness to
	God’s Son. Whom you forgive is given power to forgive you your illusions. By
	your gift of freedom is it given unto you. Make way for love, which you did
	not create, but which you <em>can</em> extend. On earth this means forgive
	your brother, that the darkness may be lifted from your mind. When light has
	come to him through your forgiveness, he will not forget his Saviour, leaving
	him unsaved. For it was in <em>your</em> face he saw the light that he would
	keep beside him, as he walks through darkness to the everlasting light.
</p>

<p>
	How holy are you, that the Son of God can be your Saviour in the midst of
	dreams of desolation and disaster. See how eagerly he comes, and steps aside
	from heavy shadows that have hidden him, and shines on you in gratitude and
	love. He is himself, but not himself alone. And as his Father lost not part of
	Him in your creation, so the light in him is brighter still because you gave
	your light to him, to save him from the dark. And now the light in you must be
	as bright as shines in him. This is the spark that shines within the dream;
	that you can help him waken, and be sure his waking eyes will rest on you. And
	in his glad salvation <em>you</em> are saved.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">
	E. Dream Roles
</h2>

<p>
	Do you believe that truth can be but <em>some</em> illusions? They are dreams
	<em>because</em> they are not true. Their equal lack of truth becomes the
	basis for the miracle, which means that you have understood that dreams are
	dreams; and that escape depends, not on the dream, but only on awaking. Could
	it be some dreams are kept, and others wakened from? The choice is not between
	which dreams to keep, but only if you want to live in dreams or to awaken from
	them. Thus it is the miracle does not select some dreams to leave untouched by
	its beneficence. You cannot dream some dreams and wake from some, for you are
	either sleeping or awake. And dreaming goes with only one of these.
</p>

<p>
	The dreams you think you like would hold you back as much as those in which
	the fear is seen. For <em>every</em> dream is but a dream of fear, no matter
	what the form it seems to take. The fear is seen within, without, or both. Or
	it can be disguised in pleasant form. But never is it absent from the dream,
	for fear is the material of dreams from which they all are made. Their form
	can change, but they cannot be made of something else. The miracle were
	treacherous indeed if it allowed you still to be afraid because you did not
	<em>recognise</em> the fear. You would not then be willing to awake, for which
	the miracle prepares the way.
</p>

<p>
	In simplest form, it can be said attack is a response to function unfulfilled
	as <em>you</em> perceive the function. It can be in you or someone else, but
	where it is perceived, it will be there it is attacked. Depression or assault
	must be the theme of every dream, for they are made of fear. The thin disguise
	of pleasure and of joy in which they may be wrapped but slightly veils the
	heavy lump of fear which is their core. And it is <em>this</em> the miracle
	perceives, and not the wrappings in which it is bound.
</p>

<p>
	When you are angry, is it not because someone has failed to fill the function
	<em>you</em> allotted him? And does not this become the ‘reason’ your attack
	is justified? The dreams you think you like are those in which the functions
	you have given have been filled; the needs which you ascribe to you are met.
	It does not matter if they be fulfilled, or merely wanted. It is the idea that
	they <em>exist</em> from which the fears arise. Dreams are not wanted more or
	less. They are desired or not. And each one represents some function which you
	have assigned; some goal which an event, or body, or a thing <em>should</em>
	represent, and <em>should</em> achieve for you. If it succeeds, you think you
	like the dream. If it should fail, you think the dream is sad. But whether it
	succeeds or fails is not its core, but just the flimsy covering.
</p>

<p>
	How happy would your dreams become if you were <em>not</em> the one who gave
	the ‘proper’ role to every figure which the dream contains. No one can fail
	but your <em>idea</em> of him, and there is no betrayal <em>but</em> of this.
	The core of dreams the Holy Spirit gives is <em>never</em> one of fear. The
	coverings may not appear to change, but what they mean <em>has</em> changed,
	because they cover something else. Perceptions are determined by their
	purpose, in that they seem to <em>be</em> what they are <em>for</em>. A shadow
	figure who attacks becomes a brother giving you a chance to help, if this
	becomes the function of the dream. And dreams of sadness thus are turned to
	joy.
</p>

<p>
	What <em>is</em> your brother for? You do not know, because <em>your</em>
	function is obscure to you. Do not ascribe a role to him which you imagine
	would bring happiness to you. And do not try to hurt him when he fails to take
	the part which you assigned to him, in what you dream your life was meant to
	be. He asks for help in every dream he has, and you have help to give him if
	you see the function of the dream as He perceives its function, Who can
	utilise all dreams as means to serve the function given Him. Because He loves
	the dreamer, not the dream, each dream becomes an offering of love. For at its
	centre is His love for you, which lights whatever form it takes with love.
</p>

<h2 id="s6">
	F. The Changeless Dwelling Place
</h2>

<p>
	There is a place in you where this whole world has been forgotten; where no
	memory of sin and of illusion lingers still. There is a place in you which
	time has left, and echoes of eternity are heard. There is a resting place so
	still no sound except a hymn to Heaven rises up to gladden God the Father and
	the Son. Where both abide are They remembered, both. And where They are is
	Heaven and is peace. Think not that you can change Their dwelling place. For
	your identity abides in Them, and where They are, forever must <em>you</em>
	be.
</p>

<p>
	The changelessness of Heaven is in you, so deep within that nothing in this
	world but passes by, unnoticed and unseen. The still infinity of endless peace
	surrounds you gently in its soft embrace, so strong and quiet, tranquil in the
	might of its Creator, nothing can intrude upon the sacred Son of God within.
	Here is the role the Holy Spirit gives to you who wait upon the Son of God,
	and would behold him waken and be glad. He is a part of you, and you of him,
	because he is his Father’s Son, and not for any purpose you may see in him.
	Nothing is asked of you but to accept the changeless and eternal that abide in
	him, for your identity is there. The peace in you can but be found in him. And
	every thought of love you offer him but brings you nearer to your wakening to
	peace eternal and to endless joy.
</p>

<p>
	This sacred Son of God is like yourself; the mirror of his Father’s love for
	you, the soft reminder of his Father’s love by which he was created, and which
	still abides in him, as it abides in you. Be very still, and hear God’s Voice
	in him, and let It tell you what his function is. He was created that you
	might be whole, for only the complete can be a part of God’s completion, Which
	created you.
</p>

<p>
	There is no gift the Father asks of you but that you see in all creation but
	the shining glory of His gift to you. Behold His Son, His perfect gift, in
	whom his Father shines forever, and to whom is all creation given as his own.
	Because he has it is it given you, and where it lies in him behold your peace.
	The quiet that surrounds you dwells in him, and from this quiet come the happy
	dreams in which your hands are joined in innocence. These are not hands that
	grasp in dreams of pain. They hold no sword, for they have left their hold on
	every vain illusion of the world. And being empty, they received, instead, a
	brother’s hand in which completion lay.
</p>

<p>
	If you but knew the glorious goal that lies beyond forgiveness, you would not
	keep hold on any thought, however light the touch of evil on it may appear to
	be. For you would understand how great the cost of holding anything God did
	not give in minds that can direct the hand to bless, and lead God’s Son unto
	his Father’s house. Would you not <em>want</em> to be a friend to him, created
	by his Father as His home? If God esteems him worthy of Himself, would
	<em>you</em> attack him with the hands of hate? Who would lay bloody hands on
	Heaven itself, and hope to find its peace? Your brother thinks he holds the
	hand of death. Believe him not. But learn, instead, how blessed are you who
	can release him, just by offering him yours.
</p>

<p>
	A dream is given you in which he is your Saviour, not your enemy in hate. A
	dream is given you in which you have forgiven him for all his dreams of death;
	a dream of hope you share with him, instead of dreaming evil separate dreams
	of hate. Why does it seem so hard to share this dream? Because unless the Holy
	Spirit gives the dream its function, it was made for hate, and will continue
	in death’s services. Each form it takes in some way calls for death. And those
	who serve the lord of death have come to worship in a separated world, each
	with his tiny spear and rusted sword, to keep his ancient promises to die.
</p>

<p>
	Such is the core of fear in every dream that has been kept apart from use by
	Him Who sees a different function for a dream. When dreams are shared, they
	lose the function of attack and separation, even though it was for this that
	every dream was made. Yet nothing in the world of dreams remains without the
	hope of change and betterment, for here is not where changelessness is found.
	Let us be glad indeed that this is so, and seek not the eternal in this world.
	Forgiving dreams are means to step aside from dreaming of a world outside
	yourself. And leading finally beyond all dreams, unto the peace of everlasting
	life.
</p>

<h2 id="s7">
	G. Forgiveness and Peace
</h2>

<p>
	How willing are you to forgive your brother? How much do you desire peace
	instead of endless strife and misery and pain? These questions are the same,
	in different form. Forgiveness <em>is</em> your peace, for hereïn lies the end
	of separation, and the dream of danger and destruction, sin and death; of
	madness and of murder, grief and loss. This is the ‘sacrifice’ salvation asks,
	and gladly offers peace instead of this”.
</p>

<p>
	Swear not to die, you holy Son of God! You make a bargain that you cannot
	keep. The Son of Life cannot be killed. He is immortal as his Father. What he
	is cannot be changed. He is the only thing in all the universe that
	<em>must</em> be one. What seems eternal all will have an end. The stars will
	disappear, and night and day will be no more. All things that come and go, the
	tides, the seasons, and the lives of men; all things that change with time,
	and bloom and fade, will not return. Where time has set an end is not where
	the eternal is. God’s Son can never change by what men made of him. He will be
	as he was and as he is, for time appointed not his destiny, nor set the hour
	of his birth and death. Forgiveness will not change him. Yet time waits upon
	forgiveness that the things of time may disappear because they have no use.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing survives its purpose. If it be conceived to die, then die it must
	unless it does not take this purpose as its own. Change is the only thing that
	can be made a blessing here, where purpose is not fixed, however changeless it
	appears to be. Think not that you can set a goal unlike God’s purpose for you,
	and establish it as changeless and eternal. You can give yourself a purpose
	that you do not have. But you can <em>not</em> remove the power to change your
	mind, and see another purpose there. Change is the greatest gift God gave to
	all that you would make eternal, to ensure that only Heaven would not pass
	away.
</p>

<p>
	You were not born to die. You cannot change, because your function has been
	fixed by God. All other goals are set in time and change that time might be
	preserved, excepting <em>one</em>. Forgiveness does not aim at keeping time,
	but at its ending, when it has no use. Its purpose ended, it is gone. And
	where it once held seeming sway is now restored the function God established
	for His Son in full awareness. Time can set no end to its fulfillment, nor its
	changelessness. There is no death because the living share the function their
	Creator gave to them. Life’s function cannot be to die. It must be life’s
	extension, that it be as one forever and forever, without end.
</p>

<p>
	This world will bind your feet and tie your hands and kill your body only if
	you think that it was made to crucify God’s Son. For even though it was a
	dream of death, you need not let it stand for this to you. Let <em>this</em>
	be changed, and nothing in the world but must be changed as well. For nothing
	here but is defined as what you see it for. How lovely is the world whose
	purpose is forgiveness of God’s Son! How free from fear, how filled with
	blessing and with happiness! And what a joyous thing it is to dwell a little
	while in such a happy place! Nor can it be forgot, in such a world, it
	<em>is</em> a little while until timelessness comes quietly to take the place
	of time.

	H. The Lingering Illusion
</h2>

<p>
	Seek not outside yourself. For it will fail, and you will weep each time an
	idol falls. Heaven cannot be found where it is not, and there can be no peace
	excepting there. Each idol that you worship when God calls will never answer
	in His place. There <em>is</em> no other answer you can substitute, and find
	the happiness His answer brings. Seek not outside yourself. For all your pain
	comes simply from a futile search for what you want, insisting where it must
	be found. What if it is not there? Do you prefer that you be right or happy?
	Be you glad that you are told where happiness abides, and seek no longer
	elsewhere. You <em>will</em> fail. But it is given you to know the truth, and
	not to seek for it outside yourself.
</p>

<p>
	No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering illusion, or
	some dream that there is something outside of himself that will bring
	happiness and peace to him. If everything is in him, this cannot be so. And
	therefore, by his coming, he denies the truth about himself, and seeks for
	something <em>more</em> than everything, as if a part of it were separated
	off, and found where all the rest of it is not. This is the purpose he bestows
	upon the body; that it seek for what he lacks, and give him what would make
	himself complete. And thus he wanders aimlessly about, in search of something
	that he cannot find, believing that he is what he is not.
</p>

<p>
	The lingering illusion will impel him to seek out a thousand idols, and to
	seek beyond them for a thousand more. And each will fail him, all excepting
	one; for he will die, and does not understand the idol that he seeks
	<em>is</em> but his death. Its form appears to be outside himself. Yet does he
	seek to kill God’s Son within, and prove that he is victor over him. This is
	the purpose every idol has, for this the role that is assigned to it, and this
	the role that cannot <em>be</em> fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you attempt to reach a goal in which the body’s betterment is cast as
	major beneficiary, you try to bring about your death. For you believe that you
	can suffer lack, and lack <em>is</em> death. To sacrifice is to give up, and
	thus to be without, and to have suffered loss. And by this giving up is life
	renounced. Seek not outside yourself. The search implies you are not whole
	within, and fear to look upon your devastation, and prefer to seek outside
	yourself for what you are.
</p>

<p>
	Idols must fall <em>because</em> they have no life, and what is lifeless
	<em>is</em> a sign of death. You came to die, and what would you expect but to
	<em>perceive</em> the signs of death you seek? No sadness and no suffering
	proclaims a message other than an idol found that represents a parody of life
	which, in its lifelessness, is really death, conceived as real and given
	living form. Yet each must fail and crumble and decay, because a form of death
	cannot be life, and what is sacrificed cannot be whole.
</p>

<p>
	All idols of this world were made to keep the truth within from being known to
	you; and to maintain allegiance to the dream that you must find what is
	outside yourself to be complete and happy. It is vain to worship idols in the
	hope of peace. God dwells within, and your completion lies in Him. No idol
	takes His place. Look not to idols. Do not seek outside yourself. Let us
	forget the purpose of the world the past has given it. For otherwise, the
	future <em>will</em> be like the past, and but a series of depressing dreams,
	in which all idols fail you, one by one, and you see death and disappointment
	everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	To change all this, and open up a road of hope and of release in what appeared
	to be an endless circle of despair, you need but to decide you do not
	<em>know</em> the purpose of the world. You give it goals it does not have,
	and thus do you decide what it is for. You try to see in it a place of idols
	found outside yourself, with power to make complete what is within by
	splitting what you are between the two. You <em>choose</em> your dreams, for
	they are what you wish, perceived as if it had been given you. Your idols do
	what you would have them do, and have the power you ascribe to them. And you
	pursue them vainly in the dream, because you want their power as your own.
</p>

<p>
	Yet where are dreams, but in a mind asleep? And can a dream succeed in making
	real the pictures it projects outside itself? Save time, my brothers; learn
	what time is <em>for</em>. And speed the end of idols in a world made sad and
	sick by seeing idols there. Your holy minds are altars unto God, and where He
	is no idols can abide. The fear of God is but the fear of loss of idols. It is
	not the fear of loss of your reality. But you have made of your reality an
	idol, which you must protect against the light of truth. And all the world
	becomes the means by which this idol can be saved. Salvation thus appears to
	threaten life, and offer death.
</p>

<p>
	It is not so. Salvation seeks to prove there <em>is</em> no death, and
	<em>only</em> life exists. The sacrifice of death is <em>nothing</em> lost. An
	idol <em>cannot</em> take the place of God. Let Him remind you of His love for
	you, and do not seek to drown His Voice in chants of deep despair to idols of
	yourself. Seek not outside your Father for your hope. For hope of happiness is
	<em>not</em> despair.
</p>

<h2 id="s9">
	I. Christ and Anti-Christ
</h2>

<p>
	What is an idol? Do you think you know? For idols are unrecognised as such,
	and never seen for what they really are. That is the only power which they
	have. Their <em>purpose</em> is obscure, and they are feared and worshipped,
	both, <em>because</em> you do not know what they are for, and why they have
	been made. An idol is an image of your brother which you would value more than
	what he <em>is</em>. Idols are made that he may be replaced, no matter what
	their form. And it is this which never is perceived and recognised. Be it a
	body or a thing, a place, a situation or a circumstance, an object owned or
	wanted, or a right demanded or achieved, it is the same.
</p>

<p>
	Let not their form deceive you. Idols are but substitutes for your reality. In
	some way, you believe they will complete your little self, for safety in a
	world perceived as dangerous, with forces massed against your confidence and
	peace of mind. They have the power to supply your lacks, and add the value
	which you do not have. No one believes in idols who has not enslaved himself
	to littleness and loss. And thus must seek beyond his little self for strength
	to raise his head, and stand apart from all the misery the world reflects.
	This is the penalty for looking not within for certainty and quiet calm which
	liberates you from the world, and lets you stand apart, in quiet and in peace.
</p>

<p>
	An idol is a false impression, or a false belief; some form of anti-Christ,
	which constitutes a gap between the Christ and what you see. An idol is a
	wish, made tangible and given form, and thus perceived as real, and seen
	outside the mind. Yet it is still a thought, and cannot leave the mind that is
	its source. Nor is its form apart from the idea it represents. All forms of
	anti-Christ oppose the Christ. And fall before His face like a dark veil which
	seems to shut you off from Him, alone in darkness. Yet the light is there. A
	cloud does not put out the sun. No more a veil can banish what it seems to
	separate, nor darken by one whit the light itself.
</p>

<p>
	This world of idols <em>is</em> a veil across the face of Christ, because its
	<em>purpose</em> is to separate your brother from yourself. A dark and fearful
	purpose, yet a thought without the power to change one blade of grass from
	something living to a sign of death. Its form is nowhere, for its source
	abides within your mind, where God abides not. Where is this place where what
	is everywhere has been excluded, and been kept apart? What hand could be held
	up to block God’s way? Whose voice could make demand He enter not? The
	‘more-than-everything’ is not a thing to make you tremble, and to quail in
	fear. Christ’s enemy is nowhere. He can take no form in which he <em>ever</em>
	will be real.
</p>

<p>
	What is an idol? Nothing! It must be believed before it seems to come to life,
	and <em>given</em> power that it may be feared. Its life and power are its
	believer’s gift, and this is what the miracle restores to what <em>has</em>
	life and power worthy of the gift of Heaven and eternal peace. The miracle
	does not restore the truth, the light the veil between has not put out. It
	merely lifts the veil, and <em>lets</em> the truth shine unencumbered, being
	what it is. It does not need belief to be itself, for it <em>has been</em>
	created, so it <em>is</em>. An idol is <em>established</em> by belief, and
	when it is withdrawn, the idol ‘dies’.
</p>

<p>
	This is the anti-Christ; the strange idea there is a power past omnipotence, a
	place beyond the infinite, a time transcending the eternal. Here the world of
	idols has been set by the idea this power and place and time are given form,
	and shape the world where the impossible has happened. Here the deathless come
	to die, the all-encompassing to suffer loss, the timeless to be made the
	slaves of time. Here does the changeless change; the peace of God, forever
	given to all living things, give way to chaos. And the Son of God, as perfect,
	sinless and as loving as his Father, come to hate a little while; to suffer
	pain, and finally to die.
</p>

<p>
	Where is an idol? Nowhere! Can there be a gap in what is infinite, a place
	where time can interrupt eternity? A place of darkness set where all is light,
	a dismal alcove separated off from what is endless, <em>has</em> no place to
	be. An idol is beyond where God has set all things forever, and has left no
	room for anything to be <em>except</em> His Will. Nothing and nowhere must an
	idol be, while God is everything and everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	What purpose has an idol, then? What is it <em>for</em>? This is the only
	question which has many answers, each depending on the one of whom the
	question has been asked. The world <em>believes</em> in idols. No one comes
	unless he worshipped them, and still attempts to seek for one that yet might
	offer him a gift reality does not contain. Each worshipper of idols harbours
	hope his special deities will give him more than other men possess. It
	<em>must</em> be more. It does not really matter more of what; more beauty,
	more intelligence, more wealth, or even more affliction and more pain. But
	<em>more</em> of something is an idol <em>for</em>. And when one fails another
	takes its place, with hope of finding more of something else. Be not deceived
	by forms the ‘something’ takes. An idol is a means for getting <em>more</em>.
	And it is <em>this</em> that is against God’s Will.
</p>

<p>
	God has not many sons, but only One. Who can have more, and who be given less?
	In Heaven would the Son of God but laugh, if idols could intrude upon his
	peace. It is for him the Holy Spirit speaks, and tells you idols <em>have</em>
	no purpose here. For more than Heaven can you never have. If Heaven is within,
	why would you seek for idols which would make of Heaven less, to give you more
	than God bestowed upon your brother and on you, as one with Him? God
	<em>gave</em> you all there is. And to be sure you could not lose it, did He
	also give the same to every living thing as well. And thus <em>is</em> every
	living thing a part of you, as of Himself. No idol can establish you as
	<em>more</em> than God. But you will never be content with being
	<em>less</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="s10">
	J. The Forgiving Dream
</h2>

<p>
	The slave of idols is a <em>willing</em> slave. For willing he must be to let
	himself bow down in worship to what has no life, and seek for power in the
	powerless. What happened to the holy Son of God that this could be his wish;
	to let himself fall lower than the stones upon the ground, and look to
	idolsthat they raise him up? Hear, then, your story in the dream you made, and
	ask yourself if it be not the truth that you believe that it is <em>not</em> a
	dream. A dream of judgement came into the mind that God created perfect as
	Himself. And in that dream was Heaven changed to hell, and God made enemy unto
	His Son.
</p>

<p>
	How can God’s Son awaken from the dream? It is a dream of judgement. So must
	he judge not, and he <em>will</em> waken. For the dream will seem to last
	while he is part of it. Judge not, for he who judges <em>will</em> have need
	of idols, which will hold the judgement off from resting on himself. Nor can
	he know the Self he has condemned. Judge not, because you make yourself a part
	of evil dreams, where idols are your ‘true’ identity, and your salvation from
	the judgement laid in terror and in guilt upon yourself.
</p>

<p>
	All figures in the dream are idols, made to save you from the dream. Yet they
	are <em>part</em> of what they have been made to save you <em>from</em>. Thus
	does an idol <em>keep</em> the dream alive and terrible, for who could wish
	for one unless he were in terror and despair? And this the idol represents,
	and so its worship <em>is</em> the worship of despair and terror, and the
	dream from which they come. Judgement is an injustice to God’s Son, and it
	<em>is</em> justice that who judges him will not escape the penalty he laid
	upon himself within the dream he made. God knows of justice, not of penalty.
	But in the dream of judgement, you attack and are condemned; and wish to be
	the slave of idols, which are interposed between your judgement and the
	penalty it brings.
</p>

<p>
	There <em>can</em> be no salvation in the dream as you are dreaming it. For
	idols must be part of it, to save you from what you believe you have
	accomplished, and have done to make you sinful, and put out the Light within
	you. Little children, It is there. You do but dream, and idols are the toys
	you dream you play with. Who has need of toys but children? They pretend they
	rule the world, and give their toys the power to move about, and talk and
	think and feel, and speak for <em>them</em>. Yet everything their toys appear
	to do is in the minds of those who play with them. But they are eager to
	forget that they made up the dream in which their toys are real, nor recognise
	their wishes are their own.
</p>

<p>
	Nightmares are childish dreams. The toys have turned against the child who
	thought he made them real. Yet <em>can</em> a dream attack? Or <em>can</em> a
	toy grow large and dangerous and fierce and wild? This does the child believe,
	because he fears his thoughts, and gives them to the toys instead. And their
	reality becomes his own, because they seem to <em>save</em> him from his
	thoughts. Yet do they keep his thoughts alive and real, but seen outside
	himself, where they can turn against him for his treachery to them. He thinks
	he <em>needs</em> them that he may escape his thoughts, because he thinks the
	thoughts are real. And so he makes of anything a toy, to make his world remain
	outside himself, and play that <em>he</em> is but a part of <em>it</em>.
</p>

<p>
	There is a time when childhood should be passed and gone forever. Seek not to
	retain the toys of children. Put them all away, for you have need of them no
	more. The dream of judgement is a children’s game, in which the child becomes
	the father, powerful, but with the little wisdom of a child. What hurts him is
	destroyed; what helps him, blessed. Except he judges this as does a child, who
	does not know what hurts and what will heal. And bad things seem to happen,
	and he is afraid of all the chaos in a world he thinks is governed by the laws
	he made. Yet is the real world unaffected by the world he thinks is real. Nor
	have its laws been changed because he did not understand.
</p>

<p>
	The real world still is but a dream. Except the figures have been changed.
	They are not seen as idols which betray. It is a dream in which no one is used
	to substitute for something else, nor interposed between the thoughts the mind
	conceives and what it sees. No one is used for something he is not, for
	childish things have all been put away. And what was once a dream of judgement
	now has changed into a dream where all is joy, because that is the
	<em>purpose</em> which it has. Only forgiving dreams can enter here, for time
	is almost over. And the forms which enter in the dream are now perceived as
	brothers, not in judgement, but in love.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiving dreams have little need to last. They are not made to separate the
	mind from what it thinks. They do not seek to prove the dream is being dreamed
	by someone else. And in these dreams a melody is heard which everyone
	remembers, though he has not heard it since before all time began.
	Forgiveness, once complete, brings timelessness so close the song of Heaven
	can be heard, not with the ears, but with the holiness which never left the
	altar which abides forever deep within the Son of God. And when he hears this
	song again, he knows he never heard it not. And where is time, when dreams of
	judgement have been put away?
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you feel fear in any form — and you <em>are</em> fearful if you do
	not feel a deep content, a certainty of help, a calm assurance Heaven goes
	with you — be sure you made an idol, and believe it will betray you. For
	beneath your hope that it will save you, lie the guilt and pain of
	self-betrayal and uncertainty, so deep and bitter that the dream cannot
	conceal completely all your sense of doom. Your self-betrayal <em>must</em>
	result in fear, for fear <em>is</em> judgement, leading surely to the frantic
	search for idols and for death.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiving dreams remind you that you live in safety, and have not attacked
	yourself. So do your childish terrors melt away, and dreams become a sign that
	you have made a new beginning, not another try to worship idols, and to
	<em>keep</em> attack. Forgiving dreams are kind to everyone who figures in the
	dream. And so they bring the dreamer full release from dreams of fear. He does
	not fear his judgement, for he has judged no one, nor has sought to be
	released through judgement from what judgement must impose. And all the while
	he is remembering what he forgot when judgement seemed to be the way to
	<em>save</em> him from its penalty.
</p>
