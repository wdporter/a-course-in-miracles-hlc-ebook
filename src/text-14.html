<h2 id="a">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Unless you are guiltless you cannot know God, Whose
Will is that you know Him. Therefore, you <em>must</em> be guiltless.
Yet if you do not accept the necessary conditions for knowing
Him you have denied Him, and do not recognise Him, though
He is all around you. He cannot be known without His Son,
whose guiltlessness is the condition for knowing Him. Accepting
His Son as guilty is denial of the Father so complete
that knowledge is swept away from recognition in the very
mind where God Himself has placed it. If you would but listen,
and learn how impossible this is! Do not endow Him with
attributes You understand. You made Him not and anything
you understand is not of Him.
</p>

<p>
Your task is not to make reality. It is here without your
making, but not without <em>you</em>. You who have thrown your
selves away and valued God so little, hear me speak for Him
and for yourselves. You cannot understand how much your
Father loves you, for there is no parallel in your experience of
the world to help you understand it. There is nothing on earth
with which it can compare, and nothing you have ever felt,
apart from Him, that resembles it ever so faintly. You cannot
even give a blessing in perfect gentleness. Would you know of
One Who gives forever, and Who knows of nothing <em>except</em>
giving?
</p>

<p>
The Children of Heaven live in the light of the blessing
of their Father, because they <em>know</em> that they are sinless. The
Atonement was established as the means of restoring guiltlessness
to the mind which has denied it, and thus denied
Heaven to itself. Atonement teaches you the true condition
of the Son of God. It does not teach you what you are, or what
your Father is. The Holy Spirit, Who remembers this for you,
merely teaches you how to remove the blocks that stand between
you and what you know. His memory is <em>yours</em>. If
you remember what <em>you</em> have made, you are remembering
nothing. Remembrance of reality is in Him, and <em>therefore</em>
in you.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">B. Guilt and Guiltlessness</h2>

<p>
The guiltless and the guilty are totally incapable of understanding
one another. Each perceives the other as like
himself, making them unable to communicate because
each sees the other <em>unlike</em> the way he sees <em>himself</em>. God
can communicate <em>only</em> to the Holy Spirit in your mind because
only He shares the knowledge of what you are with
God. And only the Holy Spirit can <em>answer</em> God for you, for
only He knows what God <em>is</em>. Everything else that you have
placed within your mind <em>cannot</em> exist, for what is not in
communication with the Mind of God has never been. Communication
with God is life. Nothing without it <em>is</em> at all.
</p>

<p>
The only part of your mind that has reality is the part
which links you still with God. Would you have <em>all</em> of it
transformed into a radiant message of God’s Love, to share
with all the lonely ones who have denied Him with you?
<em>God makes this possible</em>. Would you deny His yearning
to be known? You yearn for Him as He for you. This is forever
changeless. Accept, then, the immutable. Leave the
world of death behind, and return quietly to Heaven. There is
<em>nothing</em> of value here, and <em>everything</em> of value there.
Listen to the Holy Spirit, and to God through Him. He speaks
of you to <em>you</em>. There <em>is</em> no guilt in you, for God is blessed in
His Son as the Son is blessed in Him.
</p>

<p>
Each one of you has a special part to play in the
Atonement, but the message given to each to share is always
the same: <em>God’s Son is guiltless</em>. Each one teaches the
message differently, and learns it differently. Yet until he
teaches it and learns it, he will suffer the pain of dim awareness
that his true function remains unfulfilled in him. The
burden of guilt is heavy, but God would not have you bound
by it. His plan for your awaking is as perfect as yours is fallible.
You know not what you do, but He Who knows is with
you. His gentleness is yours, and all the love you share with
God He holds in trust for you. He would teach you nothing
except how to be happy.
</p>

<p>
Blessed Son of a wholly blessing Father, joy was created
for <em>you</em>. Who can condemn whom God has blessed? There is
nothing in the Mind of God that does not share His shining
innocence. Creation is the natural extension of perfect
purity. Your only calling here is to devote yourself, with active
willingness, to the denial of guilt in <em>all</em> its forms. To accuse
is <em>not to understand</em>. The happy learners of the
Atonement become the teachers of the innocence that is the
right of all that God created. Deny them not what is their due,
for you will not withhold it from them alone.
</p>

<p>
The inheritance of the Kingdom is the right of God’s
Son, given him in his creation. Do not try to steal it from him,
or you will <em>ask</em> for guilt and <em>will</em> experience it. Protect his
purity from every thought that would steal it away and keep it
from his sight. Bring innocence to light, in answer to the call
of the Atonement. Never allow purity to remain hidden, but
shine away the heavy veils of guilt within which the Son of
God has hidden himself from his own sight. We are all joined
in the Atonement here, and nothing else can unite us in this
world. So will the world of separation slip away, and full
communication be restored between the Father and the Son.
</p>

<p>
The miracle acknowledges the guiltlessness which
<em>must</em> have been denied to produce <em>need</em> of healing. Do not
withhold this glad acknowledgement, for hope of happiness
and release from suffering of every kind lies in it. Who is
there but wishes to be free of pain? He may not yet have
learned <em>how</em> to exchange his guilt for innocence, nor realise
that only in this exchange can freedom from pain be his. Yet
those who have failed to learn need <em>teaching</em>, <em>not</em> attack.
To attack those who have need of teaching is to fail to learn
from them.
</p>

<p>
Teachers of innocence, each in his own way, have
joined together, taking their part in the unified curriculum of
the Atonement. There is no unity of learning goals apart from
this. There is no conflict in this curriculum, which has <em>one</em>
aim however it is taught. Each effort made on its behalf is offered
for the single purpose of <em>release</em> from guilt, to the
eternal glory of God and His creation. And every teaching
that points to this points straight to Heaven, and to the
peace of God. There is no pain, no trial, no fear that teaching
this can fail to overcome. The power of God Himself supports
this teaching, and <em>guarantees</em> its limitless results.
</p>

<p>
Join your own efforts to the power that <em>cannot</em> fail
and <em>must</em> result in peace. No one can be untouched by teaching
such as this. You will not see yourself beyond the power
of God if you teach only this. You will not be exempt from the
effects of this most holy lesson, which seeks but to restore
what is the right of God’s creation. From everyone whom you
accord release from guilt you will inevitably learn <em>your</em> innocence.
The circle of Atonement <em>has</em> no end. And you will
find ever-increasing confidence in your safe inclusion in what
is for all in everyone you bring within its safety and its perfect
peace.
</p>

<p>
Peace, then, be unto everyone who becomes a teacher of
peace. For peace is the acknowledgement of perfect purity
from which no one is excluded. Within its holy circle is everyone
whom God created as His Son. Joy is its unifying attribute,
with no one left outside to suffer guilt alone. The power
of God draws everyone to its safe embrace of love and union.
Stand quietly within this circle, and attract all tortured minds
to join with you in the safety of its peace and holiness. Abide
with me within it, as teachers of Atonement, <em>not</em> of guilt.
</p>

<p>
Blessed are you who teach with me. Our power comes
not of us, but of our Father. In guiltlessness we know Him, as
He knows us guiltless. I stand within the circle, calling you to
peace. Teach peace with me, and stand with me on holy
ground. Remember for everyone your Father’s power that He
has given him. Believe not that you cannot teach His perfect
peace. Stand not outside, but join with me within. Fail not the
only purpose to which my teaching calls you. Restore to God
His Son as He created him by teaching him his innocence.
</p>

<p>
The crucifixion has no part in the Atonement. Only
the resurrection became my part in it. That is the symbol of
the release from guilt by guiltlessness. Whom you perceive
as guilty you would crucify. Yet you <em>restore</em> guiltlessness
to whomever you see as guiltless. Crucifixion is <em>always</em>
the ego’s aim. It sees <em>as guilty</em>, and by its condemnation 
it would kill. The Holy Spirit sees only guiltlessness,
and in His gentleness He would release from fear, and reëstablish
the reign of love. The power of love is in His gentleness,
which is of God and therefore cannot crucify nor suffer
crucifixion. The temple you restore becomes <em>your</em> altar, for it
was rebuilt through you. And everything you give to God <em>is</em>
yours. Thus He creates, and thus must <em>you</em> restore.
</p>

<p>
Each one you see you place within the holy circle of
Atonement or leave outside, judging him fit for crucifixion or
for redemption. If you bring him <em>into</em> the circle of purity,
you will rest there with him. If you leave him <em>without</em>, you
join him there. Judge not except in quietness which is not of
you. Refuse to accept anyone as <em>without</em> the blessing of
Atonement, and bring him <em>into</em> it by blessing him. Holiness
must be shared, for therein lies everything that makes it holy.
Come gladly to the holy circle, and look out in peace on all
who think they are outside. Cast no one out, for this is what
he seeks along with you. Come, let us join him in the holy
place of peace, which is for all of us, united as one within the
Cause of peace. 
</p>

<h2 id="s3">C. Out of the Darkness</h2>

<p>
The journey that we undertake together is the exchange
of dark for light, of ignorance for understanding. Nothing you
understand is fearful. It is only in darkness and in ignorance
that you perceive the frightening, and you shrink away from it
to further darkness. And yet it is only the hidden that can terrify,
not for what it <em>is</em>, but for its hiddenness. The obscure is
frightening <em>because</em> you do not understand its meaning. If
you did, it would be clear and you would be no longer in the
dark. Nothing has <em>hidden</em> value, for what is hidden cannot
be shared, and so its value is unknown. The hidden is <em>kept
apart</em>, but value always lies in joint appreciation. What is
concealed cannot be loved, and so it <em>must</em> be feared.
</p>

<p>
The quiet light in which the Holy Spirit dwells within
you is merely perfect openness, in which nothing is hidden,
and therefore nothing is fearful. Attack will <em>always</em> yield to
love if it is <em>brought</em> to love, not hidden <em>from</em> it. There is
no darkness that the light of love will not dispel, unless it is
concealed from love’s beneficence. What is kept <em>apart</em> from
love cannot share its healing power because it has been separated
off and kept in darkness. The sentinels of darkness
watch over it carefully, and you who made these guardians of
illusion out of nothing are now afraid of them.
</p>

<p>
Would you <em>continue</em> to give imagined power to
these strange ideas of safety? They are neither safe nor unsafe.
They do not protect; neither do they attack. They do nothing
at all, <em>being</em> nothing at all. As guardians of darkness and of
ignorance, look to them only for fear, for what they keep obscure
<em>is</em> fearful. But let them go, and what was fearful will be
so no longer. Without protection of obscurity <em>only</em> the light
of love remains, for only this <em>has</em> meaning and <em>can</em> live in
light. Everything else <em>must</em> disappear.
</p>

<p>
Death yields to life simply because destruction is not
<em>true</em>. The light of guiltlessness shines guilt away because,
when they are brought <em>together</em>, the truth of one <em>must</em>
make the falsity of its opposite perfectly clear. Keep not guilt
and guiltlessness apart, for your belief that you can have them
<em>both</em> is meaningless. All you have done by keeping them
apart is lose their meaning by confusing them with each
other. And so you do not realise that only one means anything,
and the other is wholly without sense of <em>any</em> kind.
</p>

<p>
You have interpreted the separation as a means which
you have made for breaking your communication with your
Father. The Holy Spirit reïnterprets it as a means of reëstablishing
what has not been broken but <em>has</em> been made
obscure. All things you made have use to Him, for His most
holy purpose. He <em>knows</em> you are not separate from God,
but He perceives much in your mind that lets you <em>think</em> you
are. All this, and nothing else, would He separate from you.
The power of decision, which you made <em>in place</em> of the
power of creation, He would teach you how to use on your
<em>behalf</em>. You who made it to crucify yourselves must learn
of Him how to apply it to the holy cause of restoration.
</p>

<p>
You who speak in dark and devious symbols do not
understand the language you have made. It <em>has</em> no meaning,
for its purpose is not communication, but rather, the <em>disruption</em>
of communication. If the purpose of language <em>is</em> communication,
how can this tongue mean anything? Yet even
this strange and twisted effort to communicate through <em>not</em>
communicating holds enough of love to <em>make</em> it meaningful,
if its interpreter is <em>not</em> its maker. You who made it are but
expressing conflict, from which the Holy Spirit would release
you. Leave what you would communicate to Him. He will
interpret it to you with perfect clarity, for He knows with
Whom you <em>are</em> in perfect communication.
</p>

<p>
You know not what you say, and so you know not
what is said to you. Yet your Interpreter perceives the meaning
in your alien language. He will not attempt to communicate
the meaningless. But He <em>will</em> separate out all that has
meaning, dropping off the rest and offering your true communication
to those who would communicate as truly with you.
You speak two languages at once, and this <em>must</em> lead to unintelligibility.
Yet if one means nothing and the other everything,
only that one is possible for purposes of communication.
The other but <em>interferes</em> with it.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit’s function is <em>entirely</em> communication.
He therefore must remove whatever interferes with it in
order to <em>restore</em> it. Therefore, keep no source of interference
from His sight, for He will not attack your sentinels. But
bring them to Him, and let His gentleness teach you that, in
the light, they are not fearful, and <em>cannot</em> serve to guard
the dark doors behind which nothing at all is carefully concealed.
We must open all doors and let the light come streaming
through. There are no hidden chambers in God’s temple.
Its gates are open wide to greet His Son. No one can fail to
come where God has called him if he close not the door himself
upon his Father’s welcome.
</p>

<h2 id="s4">D. Perception without Deceit</h2>

<p>
What do you <em>want</em>? Light or darkness, knowledge or
ignorance are yours, but not both. Opposites must be brought
together, and not kept apart. For their separation is only in
your mind, and they are reconciled by union as <em>you</em> are. In
union, everything that is not real <em>must</em> disappear, for truth <em>is</em>
union. As darkness disappears in light, so ignorance fades
away when knowledge dawns. Perception is the medium by
which ignorance is brought to knowledge. Yet the perception
must be without deceit, for otherwise it becomes the messenger
of ignorance rather than a helper in the search for truth.
</p>

<p>
The search for truth is but the honest searching out of
everything that interferes with truth. Truth <em>is</em>. It can be neither
lost nor sought nor found. It is there, whereëver <em>you</em> are,
being <em>within</em> you. Yet it <em>can</em> be recognised or unrecognised,
real or false to <em>you</em>. If you hide it, it becomes unreal to
you <em>because</em> you hid it and surrounded it with fear. Under
each cornerstone of fear on which you have erected your insane
system of belief the truth lies hidden. Yet you cannot
know this, for by hiding truth in fear you see no reason to believe
the <em>more</em> you look at fear the <em>less</em> you see it, and the
clearer what it <em>conceals</em> becomes.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to convince the unknowing that they
know. From their point of view, it is not true. Yet it <em>is</em> true
because <em>God</em> knows it. These are clearly opposite viewpoints
of what the ‘unknowing’ are. To God unknowing is impossible.
It is therefore not a point of view at all, but merely a belief
in something that does not exist. It is only this belief that the
unknowing have, and by it they are wrong about themselves.
They have <em>defined</em> themselves as they were not created.
Their creation was not a point of view, but rather a certainty.
Uncertainty brought to certainty does not retain <em>any</em> conviction
of reality.
</p>

<p>
You must have noticed that the emphasis has been on
bringing what is undesirable <em>to</em> the desirable; what you do
<em>not</em> want to what you <em>do</em>. You will realise that salvation
must come to you this way if you consider what dissociation
is. Dissociation is a distorted process of thinking whereby
two systems of belief which cannot coëxist are both <em>maintained</em>.
It has <em>been</em> recognised that, if they were brought
<em>together</em>, their joint acceptance would become impossible.
But if one is kept in darkness from the other, their <em>separation</em>
seems to keep them both alive, and equal in their reality.
Their joining thus becomes the source of fear, for if they meet,
acceptance <em>must</em> be withdrawn from one of them.
</p>

<p>
You <em>cannot</em> have them both, for each denies the
other. Apart, this fact is lost from sight, for each in a <em>separate</em>
place can be endowed with firm belief. Bring them
<em>together</em>, and the fact of their complete incompatibility is
instantly apparent. One will go <em>because</em> the other is seen in
the same place. Light cannot enter darkness when a mind believes
in darkness, and will not <em>let</em> it go. Truth does not
struggle against ignorance, and love does not attack fear.
What needs no protection does not defend itself. Defence is of
<em>your</em> making. God knows it not. The Holy Spirit uses defences
on <em>behalf</em> of truth only because you made them
<em>against</em> it. His perception of them, according to His purpose, 
merely changes them into a call <em>for</em> what you have <em>attacked</em>
with them.
</p>

<p>
Defences, like everything you made, must be gently
turned to your own good, translated by the Holy Spirit from
means of self-destruction to means of preservation and release.
His task is mighty, but the power of God is with Him. Therefore,
to Him, it is so easy that it was accomplished the instant
it was given Him for you. Do not delay yourselves in your return
to peace by wondering how He can fulfill what God has
given Him to do. Leave that to Him Who knows. You are not
asked to do mighty tasks yourself. You are merely asked to do
the little He suggests you do, trusting Him only to the small
extent of believing that, if He asks it, you <em>can</em> do it. You will
<em>see</em> how easily all that He asks can be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit asks of you but this: bring to Him every
secret you have locked away from Him. Open every door to
Him, and bid Him enter the darkness and lighten it away.
At your request He enters gladly. He brings the light to darkness
if you make the darkness <em>open</em> to Him. But what you
hide He cannot look upon. For He sees for <em>you</em>, and unless
you look <em>with</em> Him He cannot see. The vision of Christ is not
for Him alone, but for Him with <em>you</em>. Bring, therefore, all
your dark and secret thoughts to Him, and look upon them
<em>with</em> Him. He holds the light, and you the darkness. They
<em>cannot</em> coëxist when both of you together look on them.
His judgement <em>must</em> prevail, and He will <em>give</em> it to you as
you join your perception to His. Joining with Him in seeing is
the way in which you learn to share with Him the interpretation
of perception that leads to knowledge.
</p>

<p>
You cannot see alone. Sharing perception with Him
Whom God has given you teaches you how to <em>recognise</em>
what you see. It is the recognition that nothing you see means
<em>anything</em> alone. Seeing with Him will show you that all
meaning, including <em>yours</em>, comes not from double vision,
but from the gentle fusing of everything into <em>one</em> meaning,
<em>one</em> emotion and <em>one</em> purpose. God has One Purpose
which He shares with you. The single vision which the Holy
Spirit offers you will bring this Oneness to your mind with
clarity and brightness so intense you could not wish, for all the
world, not to accept what God would have you have. Behold
your will, accepting it as His, with all His Love as yours. All
honour to you through Him, and through Him unto God.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness you have obscured the glory God gave
you, and the power He bestowed upon His guiltless Son. All
this lies hidden in every darkened place shrouded in guilt, and
in the dark denial of innocence. Behind the dark doors which
you have closed lies nothing, because nothing <em>can</em> obscure
the gift of God. It is the closing of the doors that interferes
with recognition of the power of God that shines in you. Banish
not power from your mind, but let all that would hide your
glory be brought to the judgement of the Holy Spirit, and there
undone. Whom He would save for glory <em>is</em> saved for it. He
has promised the Father that through Him you would be
released from littleness to glory. To what He promised God
He is wholly faithful, for He shared with God the promise that
was given Him to share with <em>you</em>.
</p>

<p>
He shares it still, for <em>you</em>. Everything that promises
otherwise, great or small, however much or little valued, He
will replace with the <em>one</em> promise given unto Him to lay
upon the altar to your Father and His Son. No altar stands to
God <em>without</em> His Son. And nothing brought there that is
not equally worthy of both but will be replaced by gifts wholly
acceptable to Father <em>and</em> to Son. Can you offer guilt to God?
You cannot, then, offer it to His Son. For they are not apart,
and gifts to one <em>are</em> offered to the other.
</p>

<p>
You know not God because you know not this. And
yet you <em>do</em> know God and <em>also</em> this. All this is safe within
you, where the Holy Spirit shines. He shines not in division,
but in the meeting place where God, united with His Son,
speaks to His Son through Him. Communication between
what cannot be divided <em>cannot</em> cease. The holy meeting
place of the unseparated Father and His Son lies in the Holy
Spirit and in <em>you</em>. All interference in the communication that
God Himself wills with His Son is quite impossible here. Unbroken
and uninterrupted love flows constantly between the
Father and the Son, as <em>both</em> would have it be. And so it <em>is</em>.
</p>

<p>
Let your minds wander not through darkened corridors,
away from light’s centre. You may choose to lead yourselves
astray, but you can only be brought <em>together</em> by the
Guide appointed for you. He will surely lead you to where
God and His Son await your recognition. They are joined in
giving you the gift of oneness, before which <em>all</em> separation
vanishes. Unite with what you <em>are</em>. You <em>cannot</em> join with
anything except reality. God’s glory and His Son’s belong to
you in truth. They <em>have</em> no opposite, and nothing else <em>can</em>
you bestow upon yourselves.
</p>

<p>
There is no substitute for truth. And truth will make
this plain to you as you are brought into the place where
you must <em>meet</em> with truth. And there you must be led,
through gentle understanding which can lead you nowhere
else. Where God is, there are <em>you</em>. Such <em>is</em> the truth. Nothing
can change the knowledge given you by God into unknowingness.
Everything God created knows its Creator. For
this is how creation is accomplished by the Creator and by His
creations. In the holy meeting place are joined the Father and
His creations, and the creations of His Son with Them together.
There is one link which joins them all together, holding
them in the Oneness out of which creation happens.
</p>

<p>
The link with which the Father joins Himself to those
He gives the power to create like Him can <em>never</em> be dissolved.
Heaven itself is union with all of creation, and with its
One Creator. And Heaven remains the Will of God for you.
Lay no gifts other than this upon your altars, for nothing can
coëxist beside it. Here your meagre offerings are brought together
with the gift of God, and only what is worthy of the Father
will be accepted by the Son, for whom it was intended.
To whom God gives Himself He <em>is</em> given. Your little gifts will
vanish on the altar where He has placed His Own.
</p>

<h2 id="s5">E. The Recognition of Holiness</h2>

<p>
The Atonement does not <em>make</em> holy. 
You were <em>created</em> holy. 
It merely brings unholiness <em>to</em> holiness; or what you <em>made</em> to what you <em>are</em>. 
The bringing together of truth and illusion, of the ego to God, is the Holy Spirit’s only function. 
Keep not your making from your Father, for hiding it has cost you knowledge of Him and of yourselves. 
The knowledge is safe, but wherein is <em>your</em> safety apart from it? 
The making of time to <em>take the place</em> of timelessness lay in the decision to be not as you were. 
Thus, truth was made past, and the present was dedicated to illusion. 
And the past, too, was changed and interposed between what always was and <em>now</em>. The past which <em>you</em> remember <em>never</em> was, and represents only the denial of what <em>always</em> was.
</p>

<p>
Bringing the ego to God is but to bring error to truth,
where it stands corrected because it is the <em>opposite</em> of what
it meets, and is undone because the contradiction can no
longer stand. How long can contradiction stand when its impossible
nature is clearly revealed? What disappears in light is
not attacked. It merely vanishes because it is not true. Different
realities are meaningless, for reality must be one. It <em>cannot</em>
change with time or mood or chance. Its changelessness
is what <em>makes</em> it real. This cannot <em>be</em> undone. Undoing is
for unreality. And this reality <em>will</em> do for you.
</p>

<p>
Merely by being what it is does truth release you from
everything that it is <em>not</em>. The Atonement is so gentle you
need but whisper to it, and all its power will rush to your assistance
and support. You are not frail with God beside you.
Yet without Him you are nothing. The Atonement offers you
God. The gift which you refused is held by Him in you. His
Spirit holds it there for you. God has not left His altar, though
His worshippers placed other gods upon it. The temple still is
holy, for the Presence that dwells within it <em>is</em> holiness.
</p>

<p>
In the temple holiness waits quietly for the return of
them that love it. The Presence knows they will return to purity
and to grace. The graciousness of God will take them gently
in, and cover all their sense of pain and loss with the immortal
assurance of their Father’s Love. There, fear of
death will be replaced with joy of living. For God is Life, and
they <em>abide</em> in Life. Life is as holy as the Holiness by which it
was created. The Presence of holiness lives in everything
that lives, for holiness <em>created</em> life, and leaves not what It
created holy as Itself.
</p>

<p>
In this world you can become a spotless mirror, in
which the holiness of your Creator shines forth from you to all
around you. You can reflect Heaven <em>here</em>. Yet no reflections
of the images of other gods must dim the mirror that would
hold God’s reflection in it. Earth can reflect Heaven or hell;
God or the ego. You need but leave the mirror clean and clear
of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it.
God will shine upon it of Himself. Only the clear reflection of
Himself can <em>be</em> perceived upon it. Reflections are seen in
light. In darkness they are obscure, and their meaning seems
to lie only in shifting interpretations, rather than in themselves.
</p>

<p>
The reflection of God <em>needs</em> no interpretation. It is
<em>clear</em>. Clean but the mirror, and the message which shines
forth from what the mirror holds out for everyone to see no
one can <em>fail</em> to understand. It is the message that the Holy
Spirit is holding to the mirror that is in him. He recognises it
because he has been taught his <em>need</em> for it, but knows not
where to look to find it. Let him, then, see it in <em>you</em> and
<em>share</em> it with you.
</p>

<p>
Could you but realise, for a single instant, the power of
healing that the reflection of God, shining in you, can bring to
all the world, you could not wait to make the mirror of your
mind clean to receive the image of the holiness that heals the
world. The image of holiness which shines in your mind is not
obscure, and will not change. Its meaning to those who look
upon it is not obscure, for everyone perceives it as the <em>same</em> .
All bring their different problems to its healing light, but all
their problems are met <em>only</em> with healing there.
</p>

<p>
The response of holiness to <em>any</em> form of error is always
the same. There is no contradiction in what holiness calls
forth. Its <em>one</em> response is healing, without regard for
what is brought to it. Those who have learned to offer only
healing because of the reflection of holiness in them are ready
at last for Heaven. There, holiness is not a reflection, but
rather the actual condition of what was but reflected to them
here. God is no image, and His creations, as part of Him, hold
Him in them in truth. They do not merely <em>reflect</em> truth, for
they <em>are</em> truth.
</p>

<h2 id="s6">F. The Shift to Miracles</h2>

<p>
When no perception stands between God and His creations,
or between His Children and their own, the knowledge
of creation must continue forever. The reflections which you
accept into the mirror of your minds in time but bring eternity
nearer or farther. But eternity itself is beyond <em>all</em> time.
Reach out of time and touch it, with the help of its reflection in
you. And you will turn from time to holiness as surely as the
reflection of holiness calls everyone to lay all guilt aside. Reflect
the peace of Heaven <em>here</em>, and bring this world to
Heaven. For the reflection of truth draws everyone <em>to</em> truth,
and as they enter into it they leave all reflections behind.
</p>

<p>
In Heaven reality is shared, and not reflected. By sharing
its reflection here, its truth becomes the only perception
the Son of God accepts. And thus, remembrance of his Father
dawns on him, and he can no longer be satisfied with anything
but his own reality. You on earth have no conception of limitlessness,
for the world you seem to live in <em>is</em> a world of limits.
In this world, it is not true that anything without order of difficulty
can occur. The miracle, therefore, has a unique function,
and is motivated by a unique Teacher, Who brings the
laws of another world to this one. The miracle is the <em>one</em>
thing you can do that transcends order, being based not on differences,
but on equality.
</p>

<p>
Miracles are not in competition, and the number of
them that you can do is limitless. They can be simultaneous
and legion. This is not difficult to understand, once you conceive
of them as possible at all. What <em>is</em> more difficult to grasp
is the lack of order of difficulty which stamps the miracle
as something that must come from elsewhere, not from here.
From the world’s viewpoint, this is impossible. You have experienced
lack of competition among your thoughts, which,
even though they may conflict, can occur to you together and
in great numbers. You are so used to this that it can cause you
little surprise.
</p>

<p>
Yet you are also used to classifying some of your
thoughts as more important, larger or better, wiser or more
productive and valuable than others. And this is true about
the thoughts which cross the mind of those who think they
live apart. For some are reflections of Heaven, while others
are motivated by the ego, which but <em>seems</em> to think. The result
is a weaving, changing pattern which never rests, and is
never still. It shifts unceasingly across the mirror of your
mind, and the reflections of Heaven last but a moment, and
grow dim as darkness blots them out. Where there was light
darkness removes it in an instant, and alternating patterns of
light and darkness sweep constantly across your minds.
</p>

<p>
The little sanity which still remains is held together by a
sense of order which <em>you</em> establish. Yet the very fact that you
can <em>do</em> this and bring <em>any</em> order into chaos shows you that
you are not an ego, and that more than an ego <em>must</em> be in
you. For the ego <em>is</em> chaos, and if it were all of you no order at
all would be possible. Yet though the order which you impose
upon your minds limits the ego, it <em>also</em> limits <em>you</em>. To order
is to judge, and to arrange <em>by</em> judgement. Therefore, it is
not your function, but the Holy Spirit’s. It will seem difficult
for you to learn that you have no basis <em>at all</em> for ordering
your thoughts. This lesson the Holy Spirit teaches by giving
you shining examples to show you that your way of ordering
is wrong, but that a better way is offered you.
</p>

<p>
The miracle offers exactly the same response to every
call for help. It does not judge the call. It merely recognises
what it <em>is</em>, and answers accordingly. It does not consider
which call is louder or greater or more important. You may
wonder how you who are still bound to judgement can be
asked to do that which requires no judgement of your own.
The answer is very simple. The power of God, and <em>not</em>
of you, engenders miracles. The miracle itself is but the witness
that you have the power of God in you. That is the reason
why the miracle gives equal blessing to all who share in it,
and that is also why <em>everyone</em> shares in it. The power of
God is limitless. And being always maximal, it offers <em>everything</em>
to <em>every</em> call from <em>anyone</em>. There <em>is</em> no order of
difficulty here. A call for help is given help.
</p>

<p>
The only judgement involved at all is the Holy Spirit’s
<em>one</em> division into two categories: one of love, and the other
the call for love. <em>You</em> cannot safely make this division, for
you are much too confused either to recognise love, or to believe
that everything else is nothing but a need for love. You
are too bound to form, and not to content. What you consider
content is not content at all. It is merely form, and nothing
else. For you do not respond to what a brother <em>really</em> offers
you, but only to the particular perception of his offering by
which the ego judges it.
</p>

<p>
The ego is incapable of understanding content, and is
totally unconcerned with it. To the ego, if the form is acceptable
the content <em>must</em> be. Otherwise, it will attack the form.
You who believe you understand something of the dynamics
of the mind, let me assure you that you know nothing of it at
all. For of yourselves you <em>could</em> not know of it. The study
of the ego is <em>not</em> the study of the mind. In fact, the ego enjoys
the study of itself, and thoroughly approves the undertakings
of students who would analyse it, approving its importance.
Yet they but study form with meaningless content. For
their teacher is senseless, though careful to conceal this fact
behind a lot of words which sound impressive, but which lack
any consistent sense when they are put <em>together</em>.
</p>

<p>
This is characteristic of the ego’s judgements. Separately,
they seem to hold, but put them together, and the system of
thought which arises from joining them is incoherent and utterly
chaotic. For form is not enough for meaning, and the
underlying lack of content makes a cohesive system impossible.
Separation therefore remains the ego’s chosen condition.
For no one alone can judge the ego truly. Yet when two or
more <em>join together</em> in searching for truth, the ego
can no longer defend its lack of content. The fact of union
<em>tells</em> them it is not true.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to remember God in secret and alone.
For remembering Him means you are <em>not</em> alone, and willing
to remember it. Take no thought for yourself, for no thought
you hold <em>is</em> for yourself. If you would remember your Father,
let the Holy Spirit order your thoughts, and give only the answer
with which He answers you. Everyone seeks for love as
you do, and knows it not unless he joins with you in seeking
it. If you undertake the search together, you bring with you a
light so powerful that what you see is <em>given</em> meaning. The
lonely journey fails because it has excluded what it would
<em>find</em>.
</p>

<p>
As God communicates to the Holy Spirit in you, so
does the Holy Spirit translate His communications
<em>through</em> you so <em>you</em> can understand them. God has no
secret communications, for everything of Him is perfectly
open, and freely accessible to all, being <em>for</em> all. Nothing lives
in secret, and what you would hide from the Holy Spirit is
nothing. Every interpretation <em>you</em> would lay upon a brother
is senseless. Let the Holy Spirit <em>show</em> him to you, and teach
you both his love and need for love. Neither his mind <em>nor
yours</em> holds more than these two orders of thought.
</p>

<p>
The miracle is the recognition that this is true. Where
there is love, your brother must give it to you because of what
it <em>is</em>. But where there is <em>need</em> for love, <em>you</em> must give it because
of what <em>you</em> are. Long ago we said this course will
teach you what you are, restoring to you your identity. We
have already learned that this identity is shared. The miracle
becomes the <em>means</em> of sharing it. By supplying your identity
wherever it is <em>not</em> recognised, <em>you</em> will recognise it. And
God Himself, Who wills to be with His Son forever, will bless
each recognition of His Son with all the love He holds for him.
Nor will the power of <em>all</em> His Love be absent from any miracle
you offer to His Son. How, then, can there be any order of
difficulty among them?
</p>

<h2 id="s7">G. The Test of Truth</h2>

<p>
Yet the essential thing is learning that <em>you do not
know</em>. Knowledge is power, and all power is of God. You
who have tried to keep power for yourselves have lost it. You
still have the power, but you have interposed so much between
it and your <em>awareness</em> of it that you cannot use it.
Everything you have taught yourselves has made your power
more and more obscure to you. You know not <em>what</em> it is nor
<em>where</em>. You have made a semblance of power and a show of
strength so pitiful that it <em>must</em> fail you. For power is not a
seeming strength, and truth is beyond semblance of any kind.
Yet all that stands between you and the power of God in you
is but your learning of the false, and your attempts to undo the
true.
</p>

<p>
Be willing, then, for all of it to be undone, and be glad
that you are not bound to it forever. For you have taught
yourselves how to imprison the Son of God, a lesson so unthinkable
that only the insane, in deepest sleep, could even
dream of it. Can God learn how <em>not</em> to be God? And can His
Son, given all power by Him, learn to be powerless? What
have you taught yourselves that you can possibly prefer to
keep, in place of what you <em>have</em> and what you <em>are</em>?
</p>

<p>
Atonement teaches you how to escape forever from
everything that you have taught yourselves in the past by
showing you only what you are <em>now</em>. Learning <em>has been</em>
accomplished before its effects are manifest. Learning is therefore
in the past, but its influence determines the present by
giving it whatever meaning it holds for you. <em>Your</em> learning
gives the present no meaning at all. Nothing you have ever
learned can help you understand the present, or teach you
how to undo the past. Your past <em>is</em> what you have taught
yourselves. <em>Let it all go</em>. Do not attempt to understand
any event, or anything, or anyone in its light, for the light of
darkness by which you try to see can <em>only</em> obscure.
</p>

<p>
Put no confidence at all in darkness to illuminate your
understanding, for if you do you contradict the light, and
thereby <em>think</em> you see the darkness. Yet darkness cannot <em>be</em>
seen, for it is nothing more than a condition in which seeing
becomes impossible. You who have not yet brought all of
the darkness you have taught yourselves unto the light in you
can hardly judge the truth and value of this course. Yet God
did not abandon you. And so you have another lesson sent
from Him, <em>already</em> learned for every Child of light by Him
to Whom God gave it. This lesson shines with God’s glory, for
in it lies His power, which He shares so gladly with His Son.
</p>

<p>
Learn of His happiness, which is <em>yours</em>. But to accomplish
this, all your dark lessons must be brought willingly
to truth, and joyously laid down by hands open to receive, not
closed to take. Every dark lesson that you bring to Him Who
teaches light He will accept from you, because you do not
want it. And He will gladly <em>exchange</em> each one for the
bright lesson He has learned for you. Never believe that any
lesson you have learned <em>apart</em> from Him means anything.
</p>

<p>
You have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognise
if what you learned is true. If you are wholly free of fear
of any kind, and if all those who meet, or even think of you,
share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you
have learned God’s lesson, and not yours. Unless all this is
true there <em>are</em> dark lessons in your minds which hurt and
hinder you, and everyone around you. The <em>absence</em> of perfect
peace means but <em>one</em> thing: you <em>think</em> you do not will
for God’s Son what His Father wills for him. Every dark lesson
teaches this, in one form or another. And each bright lesson,
with which the Holy Spirit will replace the dark ones you
do not accept and hide, teaches you that you will <em>with</em> the
Father unto His Son.
</p>

<p>
Do not be concerned how you can learn a lesson so
completely different from everything you have taught yourselves.
How would you know? Your part is very simple. You
need only recognise that everything you learned you do not
<em>want</em>. Ask to be <em>taught</em>, and do not use your experiences
to confirm what <em>you</em> have learned. When your peace is
threatened, or disturbed in any way, say to yourself: 
</p>

<blockquote>
“I do not know what anything, <strong>including this</strong>, means.<br />
And so I do not know how to respond to it.<br />
And I will not use my own past learning as the light<br />
to guide me now.” 
</blockquote>

<p>
By this refusal to attempt to teach yourself what you do not
know, the Guide Whom God has given you will speak to you.
He will take His rightful place in your awareness the instant
<em>you</em> abandon it, and offer it to Him.
</p>

<p><em>You</em> cannot be your guide to miracles, for it is you
who made them necessary. And <em>because</em> you did, the
means on which you can depend for miracles has been provided
<em>for</em> you. God’s Son can make no needs His Father will
not meet, if he but turn to Him ever so little. Yet He cannot
compel His Son to turn to Him, and remain Himself. It is impossible
that God lose His Identity, for if He did, you would
lose <em>yours</em>. And being yours, He cannot change Himself, for
your Identity <em>is</em> changeless. The miracle acknowledges His
changelessness by seeing His Son as he always was, and not as
he would make himself. The miracle brings the effects which
<em>only</em> guiltlessness can bring, and thus establishes the fact
that guiltlessness must <em>be</em>.
</p>

<p>How can you, so firmly bound to guilt and committed
so to remain, establish for yourself your guiltlessness? That is
impossible. But be sure that you are willing to acknowledge
that it <em>is</em> impossible. It is only because you think that you can
run some little part, or deal with certain aspects of your lives
alone, that the guidance of the Holy Spirit is limited. Thus
would you make <em>him</em> undependable, and use this fancied
undependability as an excuse for keeping certain dark lessons
from Him. And by so limiting the guidance that you would
<em>accept</em>, you are unable to depend on miracles to answer all
your problems for you.
</p>

<p>Do you think that what the Holy Spirit would have
you <em>give</em> He would <em>withhold</em> from you? You have <em>no</em>
problems which He cannot solve by offering you a miracle.
Miracles are for <em>you</em>. And every fear or pain or trial you have
<em>has been</em> undone. He has brought all of them to light, having
accepted them <em>instead</em> of you, and recognised they
never were. There are no dark lessons He has not <em>already</em>
lightened for you. The lessons you would teach yourselves He
has corrected already. They do not exist in His Mind at 
all. For the past binds Him not, and therefore binds not you.
He does not see time as you do. And each miracle He offers
you corrects your use of time, and makes it His.
</p>

<p>He Who has freed you from the past would teach you
<em>are</em> free of it. He would but have you accept His accomplishments
as <em>yours</em> because He did them <em>for</em> you. And
because He did, they <em>are</em> yours. He has made you free of
what you made. You can deny Him, but you <em>cannot</em> call
on Him in vain. He <em>always</em> gives what He has made <em>in</em>
<em>place</em> of you. He would establish His bright teaching so
firmly in your mind that no dark lessons of guilt can abide in
what He has established as holy by His Presence. Thank God
that He is there and works through you. And all His works
are yours. He offers you a miracle with every one you let Him
do through you.
</p>

<p>
God’s Son will <em>always</em> be indivisible. As we are
held as one in God, so do we learn as one in Him. God’s
Teacher is as like to His Creator as is His Son, and through His
Teacher does God proclaim His Oneness <em>and</em> His Son’s. Listen
in silence, and do not raise your voice against Him. For He
teaches the miracle of oneness, and before His lesson division
disappears. Teach like Him here, and you will remember that
you have <em>always</em> created like your Father. The miracle of
creation has never ceased, having the holy stamp of immortality
upon it. This is the Will of God for all creation, and all
creation joins in willing this.
</p>

<p>Those who remember always that they know nothing,
but who have become willing to learn <em>everything</em>, will
learn it. But whenever they trust themselves, they will <em>not</em>
learn. They have destroyed their motivation for learning by
thinking they <em>already</em> know. Think not you understand
anything until you pass the test of perfect peace, for peace and
understanding go together, and never can be found alone.
Each brings the other <em>with</em> it, for it is the law of God they be
not separate. They are cause and effect, each to the other, so
where one is absent the other <em>cannot</em> be. 
</p>

<p>
Only those who see they cannot know <em>unless</em> the
effects of understanding are with them can really learn at all.
And for this, it must be peace they <em>want</em>, and nothing else.
Whenever you think <em>you</em> know, peace will depart from you
because you have abandoned the Teacher of Peace. Whenever
you fully realise that you know <em>not</em> peace will return, for
you will have invited Him to do so by abandoning the ego on
behalf of Him. Call not upon the ego for anything. It is only
<em>this</em> that you need do. The Holy Spirit will, of <em>himself</em>, fill
every mind that so makes room for Him.
</p>

<p>If you want peace you must abandon the teacher of
attack. The Teacher of peace will <em>never</em> abandon you. You
can desert Him, but He will never reciprocate, for His faith in
you <em>is</em> His understanding. It is as firm as is His faith in His
Creator, and He knows that faith in His Creator <em>must</em> encompass
faith in His creation. In this consistency lies His holiness,
which He cannot abandon, for it is not His Will to do so.
With your perfection ever in His sight, He gives the gift of
peace to everyone who perceives the need for peace, and who
would have it. Make way for peace, and it will come. For understanding
is in you, and from it peace <em>must</em> come.
</p>

<p>
The power of God, from which they both arise, is
yours as surely as it is His. You think you know Him not only
because, alone, it is impossible to know Him. Yet see the
mighty works that He will do through you, and you must be
convinced you did them through Him. It is impossible to
deny the Source of effects so powerful they <em>could</em> not be of
you. Leave room for Him, and you will find yourself so filled
with power that <em>nothing</em> will prevail against your peace.
And this will be the test by which you recognise that you have
understood.
</p>
