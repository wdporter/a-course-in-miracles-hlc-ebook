title: 12 — The Problem of Guilt
permalink: text-12.xhtml
---

<h2>A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The ultimate purpose of projection as the ego uses it is
<em>always</em> to get rid of guilt. Yet, characteristically, the ego attempts
to get rid of guilt from <em>its</em> viewpoint only, for much as
the ego wants to retain guilt, <em>you</em> find it intolerable, since
guilt stands in the way of your remembering God, Whose pull
is so strong that you <em>cannot</em> resist it. On this issue, then,
the deepest split of all occurs, for if you are to retain guilt, as
the ego insists, <em>you cannot be you</em>. Only by persuading
you that <em>it</em> is you could the ego possibly induce you to project
guilt, and thereby <em>keep</em> it in your mind.
</p>

<p>
Yet consider how strange a solution the ego’s arrangement
is. You project guilt to get rid of it, but you are actually
merely concealing it. You <em>do</em> experience guilt feelings, but
you have no idea why. On the contrary, you associate them
with a weird assortment of ego ideals, which the ego claims
you have failed. Yet you have no idea that you are failing the
Son of God by seeing him as guilty. Believing you are no
longer you, you do not realise that you are failing <em>yourself</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="s2">B. Crucifixion by Guilt</h2>

<p>
The darkest of your hidden cornerstones holds your belief
in guilt from your awareness. For in that dark and secret
place is the realisation that you have betrayed God’s Son by
condemning him to death. You do not even suspect this murderous
but insane idea lies hidden there, for the ego’s destructive
urge is so intense that nothing short of the crucifixion of
God’s Son can ultimately satisfy it. It does not know who the
Son of God is, because it is blind. Yet let it perceive guiltlessness
anywhere, and it will try to destroy it, because it is afraid.
</p>

<p>
Much of the ego’s strange behaviour is directly attributable
to its definition of guilt. To the ego, <em>the guiltless 
are guilty</em>. Those who do not attack are its ‘enemies’, because,
by not valuing its interpretation of salvation, they are in
an excellent position <em>to let it go</em>. They have approached
the darkest and deepest cornerstone in the ego’s foundation,
and while the ego can withstand your raising all else to question,
it guards this one secret with its life, for its existence
<em>does</em> depend on keeping this secret. So it is this secret that
we must look upon calmly, for the ego cannot protect you
against truth, and in <em>its</em> presence the ego is dispelled.
</p>

<p>
In the calm light of truth, let us recognise that you believe
you <em>have</em> crucified God’s Son. You have not admitted
to this ‘terrible’ secret because you <em>still</em> wish to crucify him
if you could <em>find</em> him. Yet the wish has hidden him from
you because it is very fearful, and you are <em>afraid</em> to find
him. You have handled this wish to kill <em>yourself</em> by <em>not</em>
<em>knowing</em> who you are, and identifying with something
<em>else</em>. You have projected guilt blindly and indiscriminately,
but you have <em>not</em> uncovered its source. For the ego <em>does</em>
want to kill you, and if you identify <em>with</em> it you must believe
<em>its</em> goal is <em>yours</em>.</p>

<p>
We once said that the crucifixion is the symbol of the
ego. When it was confronted with the <em>real</em> guiltlessness of
God’s Son it <em>did</em> attempt to kill him, and the reason it gave
was that guiltlessness is blasphemous to God. To the ego <em>the 
ego</em> is god, and guiltlessness <em>must</em> be interpreted as the final
guilt which fully justifies murder. You do not yet understand
that all your fear of this course stems ultimately from this interpretation,
but if you will consider your reäctions to it, you
will become increasingly convinced that this is so.</p>

<p>
This course has explicitly stated that its goal for you is
happiness and peace. Yet you are <em>afraid</em> of it. You have
been told again and again that it will make you free, yet you
reäct as if it is trying to imprison you. Most of the time you
dismiss it, but you do <em>not</em> dismiss the <em>ego</em>’s thought system.
You have <em>seen</em> its results and you <em>still</em> lack faith in it. You
<em>must</em>, then, believe that by <em>not</em> learning the course you are
<em>protecting</em> yourself. And you do not realise that it is only
your guiltlessness which <em>can</em> protect you.</p>

<p>
The Atonement has always been interpreted as the release
from guilt, and this is correct if it is understood. Yet
even when I have interpreted it <em>for</em> you, you have rejected it
and have <em>not</em> accepted it for yourself. You have recognised
the futility of the ego and its offerings, but though you
do not want the ego you do not look upon the alternative with
gladness. You are <em>afraid</em> of redemption, and you believe it
will kill you. Make no mistake about the depth of your fear.
For you believe that, in the presence of truth, you will turn on
yourself and destroy yourself.</p>

<p>Little children, this is not so. Your ‘guilty secret’ is
nothing, and if you will but bring it to light the Light will
dispel it. And then no dark cloud will remain between you
and the remembrance of your Father, for you will remember
His guiltless Son, who did not die because he is immortal. 
And you will see that you were redeemed <em>with</em> him, and
have never been separated <em>from</em> him. In this understanding
lies your remembering, for it is the recognition of love <em>without</em>
fear. There will be great joy in Heaven on your homecoming,
and the joy will be <em>yours</em>. For the redeemed son of
man <em>is</em> the guiltless Son of God, and to recognise him <em>is</em> your
redemption. </p>

<h2 id="s3">C. The Fear of Redemption</h2>

<p>
You may wonder why it is so crucial that you look
upon your hatred and realise its full extent. You may also
think that it would be easy enough for the Holy Spirit to show
it to you and dispel it <em>without</em> the need for you to raise it to
awareness yourself. Yet there is one more complication which
you have interposed between yourself and the Atonement
which you do not yet realise. We have said that no one will
countenance fear if he <em>recognises</em> it. Yet in your disordered
state, you are <em>not</em> afraid of fear. You do not like it, but
it is not your desire to attack which <em>really</em> frightens you.
You are not seriously disturbed by your hostility. You keep it
hidden because you are <em>more</em> afraid of what it covers.</p>

<p>You could look even upon the ego’s darkest cornerstone
without fear if you did not believe that, <em>without</em> the
ego, you would find within yourself something you fear even
more. You are <em>not</em> afraid of crucifixion. Your real terror is of
<em>redemption</em>. Under the ego’s dark foundation is the memory
of God, and it is of <em>this</em> that you are really afraid. For this
memory would <em>instantly</em> restore you to your proper place,
and it is this place that you have sought to <em>leave</em>.</p>

<p>
Your fear of attack is nothing compared to your fear of
love. You would be willing to look even upon your savage
wish to kill God’s Son if you did not believe that it <em>saves</em> you
from love. For this wish <em>caused</em> the separation. You have
protected it because you do not <em>want</em> the separation healed,
and you realise that, by <em>removing</em> the dark cloud that obscures
it, your love for your Father would impel you to answer
His call and leap into Heaven. You believe that attack is salvation
to prevent you from <em>this</em>. For still deeper than the ego’s
foundation, and much stronger than it will ever be, is your intense
and burning love of God, and His for you. This is what
you <em>really</em> want to hide.</p>

<p>In honesty, is it not harder for you to say “I love” than
“I hate”? You associate love with weakness and hatred with
strength, and your own <em>real</em> power seems to you as your
real <em>weakness</em>. For you could not control your joyous
response to the call of love if you heard it, and the whole
world you think you control <em>would</em> vanish. The Holy Spirit,
then, seems to be attacking your fortress, for you would shut
out God, and He does not will to <em>be</em> excluded.</p>

<p>You have built your whole insane belief system because
you think you would be helpless in God’s Presence, and you
would <em>save</em> yourself from His Love because you think It
would crush you into nothingness. You are afraid It would
sweep you away from yourself, and make you little. For you
believe that magnitude lies in defiance, and that attack is
grandeur. You think you have made a world which God
would destroy: and by loving Him, which you <em>do</em>, you would
throw this world away, which you <em>would</em>. Therefore, you
have used the world to <em>cover</em> your love, and the deeper you
go into the blackness of the ego’s foundation, the closer you
come to the Love that is hidden there. <em>And it is this that 
frightens you</em>.</p>

<p>You can accept insanity because you made it, but you
cannot accept love because you did <em>not</em>. You would rather
be slaves of the crucifixion than Sons of God in redemption.
For your <em>individual</em> death is more valued than your living
oneness, and what is <em>given</em> you is not so dear as what <em>you</em>
made. You are more afraid of God than of the ego, and love
cannot enter where it is not welcome. But hatred can, for it
enters of <em>its</em> will and cares not for yours.</p>

<p>The reason you must look upon your delusions and not
keep them hidden is that they do <em>not</em> rest on their own foundation.
In concealment they appear to do so, and thus they
<em>seem</em> to be self-sustained. This is the fundamental illusion on
which they rest. For <em>beneath</em> them, and concealed as long
as <em>they</em> are hidden, is the loving mind that <em>thought</em> it
made them in anger. And the pain in this mind is so apparent,
when it is uncovered, that its need of healing cannot <em>be</em> denied.
Not all the tricks and games you offer it can heal it, for
here is the <em>real</em> crucifixion of God’s Son.</p>

<p>And yet he is <em>not</em> crucified. Here is both his pain
<em>and</em> his healing, for the Holy Spirit’s vision is merciful
and His remedy is quick. Do not <em>hide</em> suffering from His
sight, but bring it gladly to Him. Lay before His eternal sanity
<em>all</em> your hurt, and <em>let</em> Him heal you. Do not leave any spot
of pain hidden from His light, and search your minds carefully
for any thoughts which you may fear to uncover. For He will
heal every little thought which you have kept to hurt you, and
cleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God.</p>

<p>Beneath all your grandiosity, which you hold so dear, is
your real call for help. For you call for love to your Father as
your Father calls you to Himself. In that place which you have
hidden you will only to unite with the Father, in loving remembrance 
of Him. You will find this place of truth as you
see it in your brothers, for though they may deceive themselves,
like you they long for the grandeur that is in them.
And perceiving it you will welcome it, and it will be <em>yours</em>.
For grandeur is the <em>right</em> of God’s Son, and <em>no</em> illusions can
satisfy him or save him from what he <em>is</em>. Only his love is real,
and he will be content <em>only</em> with his reality.</p>

<p>Save him from his illusions that you may accept the
magnitude of your Father in peace and joy. But exempt no
one from your love, or you will be hiding a dark place in your
mind where the Holy Spirit is not welcome. And you will exempt
<em>yourself</em> from His healing power, for by not offering
total love you will not be healed completely. Healing must be
as complete as fear, for love cannot enter where there is one
spot of fear to mar its welcome.</p>

<p>You who prefer specialness to sanity could not obtain
it in your right minds. You were at peace until you asked for
special favour. And God did not give it, for the request was
alien to Him, and you could not ask this of a Father Who truly
loved His Son. Therefore you made of Him an unloving father,
demanding of Him what only such a father could give.
And the peace of God’s Son was shattered, for he no longer
understood his Father. He feared what he had made, but still
more did he fear his <em>real</em> Father, having attacked his own
glorious equality with Him. </p>

<p>In peace he needed nothing and asked for nothing. In
war he <em>demanded</em> everything and <em>found</em> nothing. For
how could the gentleness of love respond to his demands <em>except</em>
by departing in peace and returning to the Father? If
the Son did not wish to remain in peace, he could not remain
at all. For a darkened mind cannot live in the light, and it
must seek a place of darkness where it can believe it is where
it is not. God did not allow this to happen. Yet you 
<em>demanded</em> that it happen, and therefore believed that it was
so.</p>

<p>To ‘single out’ is to ‘make alone’, and thus <em>make</em>
<em>lonely</em>. God did not do this to you. Could He set you
apart, <em>knowing</em> that your peace lies in His Oneness? He
denied you only your request for pain, for suffering is not of
His creation. Having <em>given</em> you creation, He could not take
it <em>from</em> you. He could but answer your insane request with a
sane answer which would abide with you in your insanity.
<em>And this he did</em>. No one who hears His answer but will
give up insanity. For His answer is the reference point <em>beyond</em>
illusions, from which you can look back on them and
<em>see</em> them as insane. But seek <em>this</em> place and you <em>will</em> find
it, for Love is in you and will lead you there. </p>

<h2 id="s4">D. Healing and Time</h2>

<p>
And now the reason why you are afraid of this course
should be apparent. For this is a course on love because it is
about <em>you</em>. You have been told that your function in this
world is healing, and your function in Heaven is creating. The
ego teaches that your function on earth is destruction, and that
you have no function at all in Heaven. It would thus destroy
you here and bury you here, leaving you no inheritance except
the dust out of which it thinks you were made. As long as it is
reasonably satisfied with you, as its reasoning goes, it offers
you oblivion. When it becomes overtly savage, it offers you
hell.</p>

<p>Yet neither oblivion nor hell is as unacceptable to you
as Heaven. For your definition of Heaven <em>is</em> hell and oblivion,
and the <em>real</em> Heaven is the greatest threat you think you
could experience. For hell and oblivion are ideas which <em>you</em>
made up, and you are bent on demonstrating their reality to
establish <em>yours</em>. If <em>their</em> reality is questioned, you believe
that <em>yours</em> is. For you believe that <em>attack</em> is your reality,
and that your destruction is the final proof that you were
<em>right</em>.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, would it not be more <em>desirable</em> 
to have been wrong, even apart from the fact that
you <em>were</em> wrong? While it could perhaps be argued that
death suggests there <em>was</em> life, no one would claim that it
proves there <em>is</em> life. Even the past life which death might indicate
could only have been futile if it must come to this, and
<em>needs</em> this to prove that it was. You question Heaven, but
you do not question <em>this</em>. You could heal and be healed if
you <em>did</em> question it. And even though you know not Heaven,
might it not be more desirable than death? You have been as
selective in your questioning as in your perception. An open
mind is more honest than this.</p>

<p>The ego has a very strange notion of time, and it is with
this notion that your questioning might well begin. The ego
invests heavily in the past, and in the end believes that the
past is the <em>only</em> aspect of time that is meaningful. You will
remember that we said its emphasis on guilt enables it to
ensure its continuity by making the future <em>like</em> the past, and
thus avoiding the present. By the notion of <em>paying</em> for the
past in the future the past becomes the <em>determiner</em> of the
future, making them continuous <em>without</em> an intervening
present. For the ego uses the present <em>only</em> as a brief transition
to the future, in which it brings the past <em>to</em> the future by
interpreting the present in <em>past</em> terms.</p>

<p><em>Now</em> has no meaning to the ego. The present merely
reminds it of past hurts, and it reäcts to the present as if it
<em>were</em> the past. The ego cannot tolerate <em>release</em> from the
past, and although the past is no more, the ego tries to preserve
its image by responding <em>as if</em> it were present. Thus it
dictates reäctions to those you meet now from a <em>past</em> reference
point, obscuring their present reality. In effect, if you follow
the ego’s dictates, you will reäct to your brothers as
though they were someone <em>else</em>, and this will surely prevent
you from perceiving them as they <em>are</em>. And you will receive
messages from them out of your <em>own</em> past because, by making
it real in the present, you are forbidding yourself to <em>let it
go</em>. You thus deny yourself the message of release that every
brother offers you <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>The shadowy figures from the past are precisely what
you must <em>escape</em>. For they are not real, and have no hold
over you unless you bring them <em>with</em> you. They carry the
spots of pain in your minds, directing you to attack in the present
in retaliation for a past that is no more. And this decision
is one of <em>future</em> pain. Unless you learn that past pain is delusional,
you are choosing a future of illusions and losing the
endless opportunities which you could find for release in the
present. The ego would <em>preserve</em> your nightmares, and
<em>prevent</em> you from awakening and understanding that they
<em>are</em> past.</p>

<p>Would you <em>recognise</em> a holy encounter if you are
merely perceiving it as a meeting with your own past? For
you are meeting no one, and the <em>sharing</em> of salvation,
which <em>makes</em> the encounter holy, is excluded from your
sight. The Holy Spirit teaches that you always meet <em>yourself</em>,
and the encounter is holy because <em>you</em> are. The
ego teaches that you always encounter your past, and because
your dreams <em>were</em> not holy the future <em>cannot</em> be, and the
present is without meaning. It is evident that the Holy Spirit’s
perception of time is the exact opposite of the ego’s. The reason
is equally clear, for they perceive the goal of time as diametrically
opposed.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit interprets time’s purpose as rendering
the need for it unnecessary. Thus does He regard the function
of time as temporary, serving only His teaching function,
which is temporary by definition. <em>His</em> emphasis is therefore
on the only aspect of time which <em>can</em> extend to the infinite,
for <em>now</em> is the closest approximation of eternity which this
world offers. It is in the <em>reality</em> of now, without past <em>or</em>
future, that the beginning of the appreciation of eternity lies.
For only now is <em>here</em>, and <em>it</em> presents the opportunities for
the holy encounters in which salvation can be found.</p>

<p>The ego, on the other hand, regards the function of
time as one of extending itself <em>in place</em> of eternity, for, like
the Holy Spirit, the ego interprets the goal of time as its own.
The continuity of past and future, under <em>its</em> direction, is the
only purpose the ego perceives in time, and it closes over the
present so that no gap in its <em>own</em> continuity can occur. <em>Its</em>
continuity, then, would <em>keep</em> you in time, while the Holy
Spirit would release you <em>from</em> it. It is <em>His</em> interpretation of
the means of salvation which you must learn to accept, if you
would share His goal of salvation for you.</p>

<p>You, too, will interpret the function of time as you interpret
yours. If you accept your function in the world of time
as healing, you will emphasise <em>only</em> the aspect of time in
which healing can occur. For healing <em>cannot</em> be accomplished
in the past, and <em>must</em> be accomplished in the present
to release the <em>future</em>. This interpretation ties the future to
the <em>present</em>, and extends the present rather than the past.
But if you interpret your function as destruction, you will lose
sight of the present and hold on to the past to <em>ensure</em> a destructive
future. And time <em>will</em> be as you interpret it, for of
itself it is <em>nothing</em>. </p>

<h2 id="s5">E. The Two Emotions</h2>

<p>
We have said that you have but two emotions, love and
fear. One is changeless but continually exchanged, being offered
<em>by</em> the eternal <em>to</em> the eternal. In this exchange it is extended,
for it <em>increases</em> as it is given. The other has many
forms, for the content of individual illusions differs greatly.
Yet they have one thing in common: they are all insane. They
are made of sights which are <em>not</em> seen and sounds which are
<em>not</em> heard. They make up a private world which <em>cannot</em>
be shared. For they are meaningful <em>only</em> to their maker, and
so they have no meaning at all. In this world their maker
moves alone, for only he perceives them.</p>

<p>Each one peoples his world with figures from his individual
past, and it is because of this that private worlds <em>do</em>
differ. Yet the figures that he sees were <em>never</em> real, for they
are made up only of <em>his</em> reäctions to his brothers, and do not
include their reäctions to <em>him</em>. Therefore he does not <em>see</em> that
he made them, and that they are not whole. For these figures
have no witnesses, being perceived in one separate mind only.</p>

<p>It is <em>through</em> these strange and shadowy figures that
the insane relate to their insane world. For they see <em>only</em>
those who remind them of these images, and it is to <em>them</em>
that they relate. Thus do they communicate with those who
are not there, and it is <em>they</em> who answer them. And no one
hears their answer save him who called upon them, and he
alone believes they answered him. Projection makes perception,
and you <em>cannot</em> see beyond it. Again and again have
men attacked each other because they saw in them a shadow
figure in their <em>own</em> private world. And thus it is that you
<em>must</em> attack yourself first, for what you attack is <em>not</em> in others.
Its only reality is in your <em>own</em> mind, and by attacking
others you are literally attacking what is <em>not there</em>.</p>

<p>The delusional can be very destructive, for they do not
recognise that they have condemned <em>themselves</em>. They do
not wish to die, yet they will not let condemnation <em>go</em>. And
so they separate into their private worlds, where everything
is disordered, and where what is within appears to be
without. Yet what <em>is</em> within they do not see, for the <em>reality</em>
of their brothers they <em>cannot</em> see.
</p>

<p>
You have but two emotions, yet in your private world
you reäct to each of them as though it were the <em>other</em>. For
love cannot abide in a world apart, where when it comes it is
not recognised. If you see your own hatred <em>as</em> your brother,
you are not seeing <em>him</em>. Everyone draws nigh unto what he
loves, and recoils from what he fears. And you reäct with fear
to love, and draw away from it. Yet fear <em>attracts</em> you, and
believing it <em>is</em> love, you call it to yourself. Your private world
is filled with the figures of fear you have invited into it, and all
the love your brothers offer you, <em>you do not see</em>. As you
look with open eyes upon your world, it <em>must</em> occur to you
that you have withdrawn into insanity.
</p>

<p>
You see what is not there, and you hear what is soundless.
Your behavioural manifestations of emotions are the <em>opposite</em>
of what the emotions are. You communicate with no
one, and you are as isolated from reality as if you were alone
in all the universe. In your madness you overlook reality
<em>completely</em>, and you see only your <em>own</em> split mind everywhere
you look. God calls you and you do not hear, for you
are preöccupied with your own voice. And the vision of
Christ is not in your sight, for you look upon yourself <em>alone</em>.
</p>

<p>
Little children, would you offer <em>this</em> to your Father?
For if you offer it to yourself you <em>are</em> offering it to Him. And
He will <em>not</em> return it, for it is unworthy of you because it is
unworthy of Him. Yet He <em>would</em> release you from it and set
you free. His sane answer tells you that what you have offered 
yourself is not true, but <em>His</em> offering to you has never
changed. You who know not what you do <em>can</em> learn what
insanity is, and look beyond it. It is given you to learn how to
<em>deny</em> insanity, and come forth from your private world in
peace.
</p>

<p>
You will see all that you denied in your brothers <em>because</em>
you denied it in yourself. For you will love them,
and by drawing nigh unto them you will draw them to yourself,
perceiving them as witnesses to your reality which you
share with God. I am with <em>them</em> as I am with <em>you</em>, and we
will draw them from their private worlds, for as we are united
so would we unite with them. The Father welcomes all of us
in gladness, and gladness is what <em>we</em> should offer <em>him</em>. For
every Son of God is given you to whom God gave <em>himself</em>.
And it is God Whom you must offer them, to recognise His
gift to <em>you</em>.
</p>

<p>
Vision depends on light, and you cannot see in darkness.
Yet in the darkness, in the private world of sleep, you
<em>see</em> in dreams although your eyes are closed. And it is here
that what you see you <em>made</em>. But let the darkness go and all
you made you will no longer see, for sight of it depends upon
<em>denying</em> vision. Yet from denying vision it does not follow
that you <em>cannot</em> see. But this is what denial <em>does</em>, for by it
you <em>accept</em> insanity, believing you can make a private
world and rule your <em>own</em> perceptions. Yet for this, light
<em>must</em> be excluded. Dreams disappear when light has come
and you can <em>see</em>.
</p>

<p>
Do not seek vision through <em>your</em> eyes, for you <em>made</em>
your way of seeing that you might see in darkness, and in this
you are deceived. <em>Beyond</em> this darkness, and yet still
<em>within</em> you, is the vision of Christ, Who looks on all in light.
Your vision comes from fear, as His from love. And He sees
<em>for</em> you as your witness to the real world. He is the Holy
Spirit’s manifestation, looking always on the real world, and
calling forth its witnesses and drawing them unto <em>you</em>. For
He loves what He sees within you, and He would <em>extend</em> it.
And He will not return unto the Father until He has extended
your perception even unto Him. And there perception is no
more, for He has returned you to the Father with Him.
</p>

<p>
You have but two emotions, and one you made and
one was given you. Each is a <em>way of seeing</em>, and different
worlds arise from their different visions. See through the vision
that is given you, for through Christ’s vision He beholds
Himself. And seeing what He is, He knows His Father. 
Beyond your darkest dreams He sees God’s guiltless Son
within you, shining in perfect radiance which is undimmed by
your dreams. And this <em>you</em> will see as you look with Him,
for His vision is His gift of love to you, given Him of the Father
<em>for</em> you.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit is the light in which Christ stands revealed.
And all who would behold Him can see Him, for they
have <em>asked</em> for light. Nor will they see Him <em>alone</em>, for He
is no more alone than they are. Because they saw the Son they
have risen in Him to the Father. And all this will they understand
because they looked within and saw beyond the darkness
the Christ in them, and <em>recognised</em> Him. In the sanity
of His vision they looked upon themselves with love, seeing
themselves as the Holy Spirit sees them. And <em>with</em> this
vision of the truth in them came all the beauty of the world to
shine upon them. 
</p>

<h2 id="s6">F. Finding the Present</h2>

<p>
To perceive truly is to be aware of <em>all</em> reality through
the awareness of your own. But for this <em>no</em> illusions can rise
to meet your sight, for <em>all</em> reality leaves no room for <em>any</em>
error. This means that you perceive a brother only as you see
him <em>now</em>. His past has <em>no</em> reality in the present, and you
<em>cannot</em> see it. <em>Your</em> past reäctions to him are <em>also</em> not
there, and if it is to them that you reäct <em>now</em>, you see but an
image of him which you made and cherish <em>instead</em> of him.
In your questioning of illusions, ask yourself if it is <em>really</em>
sane to perceive what <em>was now</em>. If you remember the past
as you look upon your brother, you will be unable to perceive
the reality that is <em>now</em>.
</p>

<p>
You consider it ‘natural’ to use your past experience as
the reference point from which to <em>judge</em> the present. Yet this
is <em>unnatural</em> because it is delusional. When you have
learned to look upon everyone with <em>no reference at all</em>
to the past, either his or yours as you perceived it, you will be
able to learn from what you see <em>now</em>. For the past can cast
no shadow to darken the present <em>unless you are afraid
of light</em>. And only if you are would you choose to bring
this darkness <em>with</em> you, and by holding it in your minds, see
it as a dark cloud that shrouds your brothers and conceals
their reality from your sight.
</p>

<p>
<em>This darkness is in you</em>. The Christ revealed to
you <em>now</em> has no past for He is changeless, and in <em>his</em>
changelessness lies <em>your</em> release. For if He is as He was created,
there is no guilt in Him. No cloud of guilt has risen to
obscure Him, and He stands revealed in everyone you meet
because you see Him through <em>himself</em>. To be born again is
to <em>let the past go</em> and look without condemnation upon
the present. For the cloud which obscures God’s Son to you <em>is</em>
the past, and if you would have it past <em>and gone</em>, you must
not see it <em>now</em>. If you see it now in your delusions it has
<em>not</em> gone from you, although it is not there.
</p>

<p>
Time can release as well as imprison, depending on
whose interpretation of it you use. Past, present and future
are not continuous unless you <em>force</em> continuity on
them. You can <em>perceive</em> them as continuous, and make
them so for <em>you</em>. But do not be deceived and then believe
that this is how it <em>is</em>, for to believe that reality is what you
would <em>have</em> it be according to your use for it <em>is</em> delusional.
You would destroy time’s continuity by breaking it into past,
present and future <em>for your own purposes</em>. You would
anticipate the future on the basis of your past experience and
plan for it accordingly. Yet by doing so you are <em>aligning</em>
past and future, and not allowing the miracle, which could intervene
<em>between</em> them, to free you to be born again.
</p>

<p>
The miracle enables you to see your brother <em>without</em>
his past, and so perceive <em>him</em> as born again. His errors <em>are</em>
all past, and by perceiving him without them you are <em>releasing</em>
him. And since his past is <em>yours</em>, you <em>share</em> in
this release. Let no dark cloud out of <em>your</em> past obscure him
from you, for truth lies <em>only</em> in the present, and you will find
it if you seek it there. You have looked for it where it is <em>not</em>,
and therefore have not found it. Learn, then, to seek it where
it <em>is</em>, and it will dawn on eyes that see. Your past was made in
anger, and if you use it to attack the present you will not <em>see</em>
the freedom that the present holds. Judgement and condemnation
are <em>behind</em> you, and unless you bring them <em>with</em> you,
you will see that you <em>are</em> free of them.
</p>

<p>
Look lovingly upon the present, for it holds the <em>only</em>
things that are forever true. All healing lies within it because
<em>its</em> continuity is real. It extends to all aspects of consciousness
<em>at the same time</em>, and thus enables them to reach <em>each
other</em>. The present is before time was, and will be when
time is no more. In it is everything that is eternal, and they are
one. Their continuity is timeless and their communication is
unbroken, for they are not separated by the past. Only the
past <em>can</em> separate, and <em>it</em> is nowhere.
</p>

<p>
The present offers you your brothers in the light that
would unite you with them and free you <em>from</em> the past.
Would you, then, hold the past <em>against</em> them? For if
you do, you are choosing to remain in the darkness that is not
there, and refusing to accept the light that is offered you. For
the light of perfect vision is freely given as it is freely received,
and can be accepted only <em>without limit</em>. In this one, still
dimension of time, which does not change and where there is
no sight of what you were, you look at Christ and call His witnesses
to shine on you <em>because you called them
forth</em>. And <em>they</em> will not deny the truth in you because
you looked for it in them and <em>found</em> it there.
</p>

<p>
Now is the time of salvation, for now is the <em>release</em>
from time. Reach out to all your brothers, and touch them
with the touch of Christ. In timeless union with them is <em>your</em>
continuity, unbroken because it is wholly shared. God’s guiltless
Son is <em>only</em> light. There is no darkness in him anywhere,
for he is whole. Call all your brothers to witness to his wholeness,
as I am calling you to join with me. Every voice has a
part in the song of redemption, the hymn of gladness and
thanksgiving for the light to the Creator of light. The holy
light that shines forth from God’s Son is the witness that his
light is of his Father.
</p>

<p>
Shine on your brothers in remembrance of your Creator,
for you will remember Him as you call forth the witnesses
to His creation. Those whom you heal bear witness to <em>your</em>
healing, for in their wholeness you will see your own. And as
your hymns of praise and gladness rise to your Creator, He
will return your thanks in His clear answer to your call. For it
can never be that His Son called upon Him and remained unanswered.
His call to you is but your call to Him. And <em>in</em>
Him you are answered by His peace.
</p>

<p>
Children of Light, you know not that the light is in
you. Yet you will find it through its witnesses, for having
<em>given</em> light to them they will <em>return</em> it. Everyone you see
in light brings <em>your</em> light closer to your <em>own</em> awareness.
Love always leads to love. The sick, who ask for love, are
grateful for it, and in their joy they shine with holy thanks.
And this they offer you who <em>gave</em> them joy. They are your
guides to joy, for having received it of you they would
keep it. You have established them as guides to peace, for you
have made it manifest in them. And <em>seeing</em> it, its beauty
calls <em>you</em> home.
</p>

<p>
There is a light which this world cannot give. Yet <em>you</em>
can give it, as it was given you. And as you give it, it shines
forth to call you from the world and follow it. For this light
will attract you as nothing in this world can do. And you will
lay aside the world and find another. This other world is
bright with love which <em>you</em> have given it. And here will everything
remind you of your Father and His holy Son. Light is
unlimited, and spreads across this world in quiet joy. All
those you brought with you will shine on you, and you will
shine on them in gratitude because they brought you here.
Your light will join with theirs in power so compelling that it
will draw the others out of darkness as you look on them.
</p>

<p>
Awakening unto Christ is following the laws of love of
your free will, and out of quiet recognition of the truth in
them. The attraction of light must draw you willingly, and
willingness is signified by <em>giving</em>. Those who accept love of
you become your willing witnesses to the love you gave them,
and it is <em>they</em> who hold it out to <em>you</em>. In sleep you are
alone, and your awareness is narrowed to yourself. And that
is why the nightmares come. You dream of isolation <em>because</em>
your eyes are closed. You do not <em>see</em> your brothers,
and in the darkness you cannot look upon the light you gave
to them.
</p>

<p>
And yet the laws of love are not suspended because
you sleep. And you have followed them through all your
nightmares, and have been faithful in your giving, for you
were <em>not</em> alone. Even in sleep has Christ protected you, ensuring
the real world for you when you wake. In <em>your</em> name
He has given <em>for</em> you, and given <em>you</em> the gifts He gave.
God’s Son is still as loving as his Father. Continuous <em>with</em>
his Father, he has no past apart from Him. So he has never
ceased to be his Father’s witness <em>and his own</em>. Although
he slept, Christ’s vision did not leave him. And so it is that he
can call unto himself the witnesses that teach him that he
never slept. 
</p>

<h2 id="s7">G. Attainment of the Real World</h2>

<p>
Sit quietly and look upon the world you see, and tell
yourself: 
</p>

<blockquote>
“The real world is not like this. It has no buildings, and there are
no streets where people walk alone and separate. There are no
stores where people buy an endless list of things they do not need.
It is not lit with artificial light, and night comes not upon it.
There is no day that brightens and grows dim. There is no loss.
Nothing is there but shines, and shines forever.”
</blockquote>

<p>
The world <em>you</em> see must be <em>denied</em>, for sight of it is
costing you a different kind of vision. <em>You cannot see
both worlds</em>, for each of them involves a different kind of
seeing and depends on what you cherish. The sight of one is
possible <em>because</em> you have denied the other. Both are not
true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the amount to
which you hold it dear. And yet their power is <em>not</em> the same
because their real attraction to you is unequal.
</p>

<p>
You do not really want the world you see, for it has
disappointed you since time began. The homes you built have
never sheltered you. The roads you made have led you nowhere,
and no city that you built has withstood the crumbling
assault of time. Nothing you made but has the mark of death
upon it. Hold it not dear, for it is old and tired, and ready to
return to dust even as you made it. This aching world has not
the power to touch the living world at all. You could not give
it that, and so although you turn in sadness from it, you cannot
find in <em>it</em> the road that leads away from it into another
world.
</p>

<p>
Yet the real world has the power to touch you even
here <em>because you love it</em>. And what you call with love
<em>will</em> come to you. Love <em>always</em> answers, being unable to
deny a call for help, or not to hear the cries of pain that rise to
it from every part of this strange world you made but do not
want. The only effort you need make to give this world away
in glad exchange for what you did not make is willingness to
learn <em>the one you made is false</em>. 
</p>

<p>
You <em>have</em> been wrong about the world because you
have misjudged <em>yourself</em>. From such a twisted reference
point what <em>could</em> you see? All vision starts <em>with the
perceiver</em>, who judges what is true and what is false. And
what he judges false <em>he does not see</em>. You who would
judge reality <em>cannot</em> see it, for whenever judgement enters
reality has slipped away. The out of mind is out of sight because
what is denied is there, but is not <em>recognised</em>. Christ
is still there, although you know Him not. His Being does not
depend upon your recognition. He lives within you in the
quiet present, and waits for you to leave the past behind and
enter into the world He holds out to you in love.
</p>

<p>
No one in this distracted world but has seen some
glimpses of the other world about him. Yet while he still lays
value on his own, he will <em>deny</em> the vision of the other world,
maintaining that he loves what he loves not, and following not
the road that love points out. Love leads so gladly! And as
you follow Him, you will rejoice that you have found His
company, and learned of Him the joyful journey home. You
wait but for <em>yourself</em>. To give this sad world over and exchange
your errors for the peace of God is but <em>your</em> will.
And Christ will <em>always</em> offer you the Will of God, in recognition
that you share it with Him.
</p>

<p>
It is God’s Will that nothing touch His Son except Himself,
and nothing else comes nigh unto him. He is as safe from
pain as God Himself, Who watches over him in everything.
The world about him shines with love because God placed
him in Himself where pain is not, and love surrounds him
without end or flaw. Disturbance of his peace can never be.
In perfect sanity he looks on love, for it is all about him and
within him. He <em>must</em> deny the world of pain the instant he
perceives the arms of love around him. And from this point of
safety he looks quietly about him, and recognises that the
world is one with him.
</p>

<p>
The peace of God passeth your understanding <em>only</em>
in the past. Yet here it <em>is</em>, and you can understand it <em>now</em>.
God loves His Son forever, and His Son <em>returns</em> his
Father’s Love forever. The real world is the way that leads
you to remembrance of this one thing that is wholly true and
wholly <em>yours</em>. For all else you have lent yourself in time,
and it will fade. But this one thing is <em>always</em> yours, being
the gift of God unto His Son. Your <em>one</em> reality was given
you, and by it God created you as one with Him.
</p>

<p>
You will first dream of peace, and then awaken to it.
Your first exchange of what you made for what you want is
the exchange of nightmares for the happy dreams of love. In
these lie your true perceptions, for the Holy Spirit corrects the
world of dreams where <em>all</em> perception is. Knowledge needs
no correction. Yet the dreams of love lead <em>unto</em> knowledge.
In them you see nothing fearful, and because of this they are
the welcome that you <em>offer</em> knowledge. Love waits on welcome,
<em>not</em> on time, and the real world is but your welcome of
what always was. Therefore the call of joy is in it, and your
glad response is your awakening to what you have not lost.
Praise, then, the Father for the perfect sanity of His most holy
Son.
</p>

<p>
Your Father knows that you have need of nothing.
In Heaven this is so, for what could you need in eternity? In
<em>your</em> world you <em>do</em> need things because it is a world of scarcity
in which you find yourself <em>because</em> you are lacking. Yet
<em>can</em> you find yourself in such a world? Without the Holy
Spirit the answer would be no. Yet because of Him the answer
is a joyous <em>yes</em>! As Mediator between the two worlds, He
knows what you have need of and what will not hurt you.
Ownership is a dangerous concept if it is left to you. The ego
wants to <em>have</em> things for salvation, for possession is its law.
Possession for its <em>own</em> sake is the ego’s fundamental creed, a
basic cornerstone in the churches that it builds unto itself.
And at <em>its</em> altar it demands you lay <em>all</em> of the things it bids
you get, leaving you no joy in them.
</p>

<p>
Everything that the ego tells you that you need will
hurt you. For although the ego urges you again and again to
<em>get</em>, it leaves you nothing, for what you get it will <em>demand</em>
of you. And even from the very hands that grasped it,
it will be wrenched and hurled into the dust. For where the
ego sees salvation it sees <em>separation</em>, and so you lose
</p>

<p>
whatever you have gotten in its name. Therefore ask not of
yourselves what you need, for <em>you do not know</em>, and
your advice unto yourself <em>will</em> hurt you. For what you think
you need will merely serve to tighten up your world
<em>against</em> the light, and render you unwilling to question the
value that this world can really hold for you.
</p>

<p>
Only the Holy Spirit <em>knows</em> what you need. For He
will give you all things that do not block the way to light. And
what else <em>could</em> you need? In time, He gives you all the
things that you need have, and will renew them as long as you
have need of them. He will take nothing from you as long as
you have <em>any</em> need of it. And yet He knows that everything
you need is temporary, and will but last until you step aside
from <em>all</em> your needs, and learn that all of them <em>have been</em>
fulfilled. Therefore He has no investment in the things that He
supplies except to make certain that you will not use them on
behalf of lingering in time. He knows that you are not at home
there, and He wills no delay to wait upon your joyous homecoming.
</p>

<p>
Leave, then, your needs to Him. He will supply them
with no emphasis at all upon them. What comes to you of
Him comes safely, for He will ensure it never can become a
dark spot, hidden in your mind, and kept to hurt you. Under
His guidance you will travel light and journey lightly, for His
sight is ever on the journey’s end, which is His goal. God’s
Son is not a traveller through <em>outer</em> worlds. However holy
his perception may become, no world outside himself holds
his inheritance. Within himself he <em>has</em> no needs, for light
needs nothing but to shine in peace, and from itself to let the
rays extend in quiet to infinity.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you are tempted to undertake a foolish
journey that would lead <em>away</em> from light, remember what
you really want, and say, 
</p>

<blockquote>
“The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ,<br />
and where else would I go?<br />
What need have I but to awake in Him?”
</blockquote>

<p>
Then follow Him in joy, with faith that He will lead you safely
through all dangers to your peace of mind that this world sets
before you. Kneel not before the altars to sacrifice, and seek
not what you will surely lose. Content yourselves with what
you will as surely <em>keep</em>, and be not restless, for you undertake
a quiet journey to the peace of God, where He would have you
be in quietness.
</p>

<p>
In me you have already overcome <em>every</em> temptation
that would hold you back. We walk together on the way to
quietness that is the gift of God. Hold me dear, for what except
your brothers <em>can</em> you need? We will restore to you the
peace of mind that we must find <em>together</em>. The Holy Spirit
will teach you to awaken unto us and to yourself. This is the
only <em>real</em> need to be fulfilled in time. Salvation <em>from</em> the
world lies only here. My peace I <em>give</em> you. <em>Take</em> it of me in
glad exchange for all the world has offered but to take away.
And we will spread it like a veil of light across the world’s sad
face, in which we hide our brothers <em>from</em> the world, and it
from them.
</p>

<p>
We cannot sing redemption’s hymn alone. My task is
not completed until I have lifted every voice with mine. And
yet it is <em>not</em> mine, for as it is my gift to you, so was it the Father’s
gift to me, given me through His Spirit. The sound of it
will banish sorrow from the mind of God’s most holy Son,
where it cannot abide. Healing in time <em>is</em> needed, for joy cannot
establish its eternal reign where sorrow dwells. You dwell
not here, but in eternity. You travel but in dreams while safe
at home. Give thanks to every part of you that you have
taught how to <em>remember</em> you. Thus does the Son of God
give thanks unto his Father for his purity. 
</p>
